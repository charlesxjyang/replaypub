Rumours of his theory that the earth moves round the &#x27;sun, had been current since 1515, twenty eight years before he published it &#x27; &#x27;\u00b7 in De Revolutionibus Orbium Celestium just before his death in 1543. Two years before this, in 1541, he received a latter from a Luther- an minister in Nuremberg, named Andreas Osiander, urging him not to regard his theory as true, but merely as a hypothesis, suitable to serve as a foundation for calcuia.t.ions. And when the book came &#x27; .. -,\\ out, it was prefaced by an Advice to the Reader, generally attri- buted to Osiander, in which he elaborated his warnings. He wrote that astronomy cannot B:_,rrive at the truth for it ignores the causes of stellar motion; it should only propose hypotheses in accordance .\u2022. with observations and these hypotheses need not be true nor even probable. This view coincides substantially with the positivist theory of Ernst Mach, which regards science as a convenient functional re- lation between observed data. This theory purports to exclude all metaphysical claims of science by restricting it to the formulation0\u2022 of functional relations between observed data. We shall see that this intention was also present, though with an altogether differ- ent cotive, in the intervention of Osiander. To this intervention Copernicus replied in the First Dook of his volume by claiming that his system was true for it had symme- I</p>\n<p>&quot; tries, and harmonies exclusively its .01\u00b7m. The orders and magnitudes of all stars and spheres \u2022\u2022. become so bound together that nothing in any part thereof could be moved from its place without producing confusion in all other parts, and of the universe as a whole. .- \u00b7t)~?-~ ~-~.:i This refers to the way major epicycles of Ptolemy ap~,re- , . ,. .,, . 1t 2 . &#x27;:-&#x27;\\\u00b5,~ ! ., placed by a pattern of suitably spaced circular orbits centering on the sun. The planet is observed at different points moving east~1ards &#x27;\u00b7 against the firmament of fixed stars. Dut not steadily. It speeds up, sloHs down, retraces its step and resumes this oscillation at regular intervals\u00b7. This is explained by placing it on a circular orbit with a wheel attached to it: the epicycle. &#x27; . - Copernicus shov1s that the same complex motion can be explained by placing earth on a circular orbit round the sun and the other planet on another orbit round which it moves faster or slower than the earth, The planet,. observed from the earth, will then be seen to pursue the same kind of periodically oscillating circular tra- .1ectory, as ~,as described before in terms of the epicyclical mech- anism (used by Ptolemy). Dut this does not suffice. In order to eliminate the epicycle, we must ascribe one particular orbital distance to the planet (as measu~ed in the earth 1s distance from the sun). So that, in the end, we shall have fixed the solar dis- tances of all five planets in terms of the earth&#x27;s solar distance . .-&#x27; This was the triumph of Copernicus: the internal coherence of his system. It was enhanced further by the harmonious sequence of or- bital periods nou apparent for all six planets, the earth being placed among them. (See table), Osiander had attacl&lt;ed the claims of Copernicus on the grounds</p>\n<p>3 that science could no more than save the phenomena by a suitable hypothesis, which need not be true, nor even probable. This attaclc was continued later against the Copernicans. Galileo was attacked on these grounds and put on trial by Pope Urban the VIIIth. On behalf of the Roman church, Cardinal Dellarmine pressed him to ac- knoWl!::!dge \u00b7ri;~::;.:,:., __ . that the heliocentric system was but a coniput;tl&#x27;.ig, .device, &quot; but Galileo resisted this. I .. _&#x27; . :_ ,t, I have said that Osiander I i&#x27;lt&#x27;tack on the views\u00b7of Copernicus coincides with the positivist view that a scientific,theory is but a convenient description of observed facts. . ... . The coincidence of these two historically remote positions was borne out earlier in this century by a leading positivist writer, Paui Duhem, who declared that it was Cardinal Dellarmine and Osiander and not Galileo and Kepler who had grasped the precise significance of the experimental methog. I Henri Poincare too con- demned the &quot;residual metaphysics&quot; to which Galileo was adhering. Dut the grounds on which the clergy attacked Copernicanism were quite different from those on which the positivists objected to it. The clergy defended the medieval view, formulated by Aquinas, that empirical astronomy cannot speak of metaphysical re- ality. It defended the privilege of philosophic reason to speak of reality against encroachment by science. The positivists re- jected, on the contrary, any met~physical statements.as empty and confusing, and aimed at purifying science from any such claims. They demanded that science should refrain from claiming to be true- or to be bearing on reality. The position of the two different attacks on Copernicanism can be illustrated by a diagram. The medieval position shows rea- son bearing metaphysically on reality, while barring science from</p>\n<p>,, 4 such bearing. The positivist position is shown isolating science both from reason and reality, self contained in strict empiricism. Copernicanism is sho.wn, thirdly, claiming to exercise reason through science with a bearing on reality. DI,\\GRAMS \u00b7t):,S:-_ .. ; In this three cornered dispute I shall side witJi,,..t~, Coperni- cans&quot;; I agree with the posit:tvists in pointing out that:&#x27;~fu~ Coper- nicans were making metaphysical claims, but I side against them by agreeing with the medievalists, that such claims are not empty \\ but, on the contrary, essential to all true knowledge. Seen in this light, the medievalists were right, in recognising empirical science as encroaching on their domain, but wrong in contesting that science was competent to do so. The Copernicans\u00b7were right in every respect. The difficulty in meeting the positivist criticism of Coperni- canism lies in the fact that there is such an obvious answer to it, namely, that the Copernicans were right, because the earth does in ~ fact go round the sun. Dut, of course, Duhem and ?oincare could not have overlool{ed this fact. They must have meant that Kepler and Galileo were wrong, and Copernicus himself even more wrong, in asserting this fact on the grounds of evidence which could be rep- resented also by an earth centered system. To this we may obJect that Kepler and Galileo--though not Copernicus--had one strong reason for asserting the reality of the,.. heliocentric system. They may have felt that it must be real, since it l&#x27;las by relying on the Copernican system to be real, that they had made their own great discoveries. Dut we must ask vhether any such feeling could possibly be</p>\n<p>5 justified. If we are to accept the connection to be other than accidental, we must see clear1y how the Copernican system could exercise such heuristic powers, which the Ptolemaic system would lack. The first point to note in this connection is,~ful.t,, .. ,Qopernicus .. , ..... : : , and his followers clearly felt a deficiency\u00b7 in thei; s;~t~fu which \u2022 \u00b7, \u20221; ..... ~hey tried to remedy. They felt that there must be some good rea- son for the central position of the sun l&quot;lith the planets going . \\ round it. \u00b7\u00b7-Copernicus argued that the sun as giver of all light must be the center of the Universe. Kepler insisted on the natural pre_-eminence of the sun and came near the truth by assuming that the sun emits a motive spirit (anima motrix) which keeps the plan- ets going round. Thus the problem\u00b7wa-s kept open and alive until Newton solved it by the discovery of general gravitation .. This shows how Copernicus and his followers were guided by &#x27; the heliocentric system to their enquiries. They pursued the prob- lems suggested by a Copernican layout of the Universe. Kepler&#x27;s Third Law, relating the square of planetary periods inversely to the cube of planetary distances from the_ sun, also elaborated a problem set by Copernicus, by observing how orbital periods steadi- ly increase with the planet&#x27;s distance from the sun. The First and Second Laws introducing the elliptic paths, with the sun in one focus\u00b7of them, could hardly have been conceived by anyone who ig- / nored the heliocentric system; for it made no sense in the Ptole- maic system. i\\nd it was of course Kepler&#x27;s laus, combined 1\u00b71ith findings of Galileo, that set Newton his task and prepared his tri- umph, Vle can take it as a fact then that the Copernican system did</p>\n<p>6 indicate good problems which were not visib.le in the Ptolemaic system. Let us no\\&#x27;1 try to identify the process by which Coperni- canism suggested such good problems. This brings up an awl&lt;ward question, which to my knowledge, has never been systematically examined, &#x27;l.&#x27;he questioi&#x27;l-Tu.:...,, What is a \u00b7,,\u00b7 \u2666 . .,..~ \u2022\u2022\u2022 f ...,-.,. problem? Not the kind of problem set to students o;f};1~thematics or &#x27;-.. to chemists in practical classes but a scientific problem the solu- tion of \\\u00b7rhich is unlmown; the l&lt;ind of problem a scientist embarks on with a reasonable hope to discover something new that will be \\ &#x27;\u2022 worth the labour and expenses of the search for it. I would answer that to have such a problem, a good problem, is to surmise the presence of something hidden, and yet possibly accessible, lying in a certain oireqtion. A gooo problem--let me repeat--is a surmise of something h.1dclen yet accessible by an en- quiry in a certain direction. Such a surmise\u00b7is evoked in the imagination of a scientist by a set of circumstances which come to be seen as clues to a hioden thing. When the problem is solved, these clues will seem to form part of the hidden thing that is now discovered, The clL.tes of a problem thus anticipate parts or aspects of a future discovery. The heliocentric system of Copernicus could raise a problem to be answered by the discovery of general gravitation because it was itself an aspect of the theory of general gravitation; and the,; same is true of Kepler 1s discoveries which lay on the way to Newton 1s work. Copernicus anticipated important aspects of Kep- ler&#x27;s three\u00b71aws. The anticipations contained in the heliocentric theory are sharply distinct from its explicit predictions. The celestial</p>\n<p>7 timetable set out by Copernicus was not markedly different from that of Ptolemy. Close on to a century and a half following the death of Copernicus all efforts to discriminate between the two systems on the grounds of their observable quantitative predic- tions have failed. 1&#x27;/hile the discoveries of Keplei-.:;;a~, Galileo \u00b7~ ~rt.;-&#x27; ba~ed on the heliocentric system greatly increased it_~_.p:-i&#x27;ausibility, . &#x27; \u00b7~ a medieval thinker like Delarmine and such distinguished scien- tists of our 01-m days, as Duhem anci Poinca.re, from a. positivist point. of ,View, could still regard the factual content of the two &#x27;\u00b7 . rival-system as having been identical, And they were right. Faced with this fact we may as!{ once more, How can one of&#x27; two systems having the same predictive content, so vastly exceed the other in its anticipations? The ansr1er is given already in what I have just. described in detail. Th~-\u2022 a_nticipatory powers of the Copernican system lay in the new image by which it represented the &#x27; predictive content of the Ptolemaic system. It is in the appear- ance of the new system that lay its immense superiority; it is this image that originated the Copernican revolution. I am drawing here a distinction which will prove decisive. I distinguish between the precise predictive content of a mathemati- cal theory consisting in a functional relation of measured vari- ables and a meaning of the theory which goes beyond this. While these functional relations remain the same, whatever symbols are ;- used for presenting them, the surplus of meaning which goes beyond this depends on the appearance of the theory. The way this may come about can be illustrated from everyday life. Suppose \\&#x27;Te have a list of all the towns of England, each with its precise longitude and latitude, and the number of its in-</p>\n<p>8 habitants, and we represent these data in a map, each town being marked by a circle corresponding to it in size. The mapping of the list adds .no new data to it, yet it conveys a far better under- standing of these data. It reveals for example the 1~-~ the popula- . -\u00b7.-~-, . \u00b7-;j-~! i.&#x27; tion&quot;.is distributed through the country and suggests Cl;tJ~~t_ions about the reasons of physical geography and history wh1qh will ac- count for this distribution. The map will guide the imagination \\ to enter on fruitful enquiries to which the original list v10uld leave us blind. We can, in fact, give a fairly close analogy between the Ptolemaic and the Copernican system in such terms. Suppose you are interested only in a certain number of itineraries. They could . , .. &quot; . be conveniently represented separately ~n several lines. You some- times find this kind of indication in guide bo.ol&lt;s; Dut the travel- ler may use instead a map on which he can trace the itineraries for himself. The first representation corresponds to the Ptolemaic, the second to the Copernican system, It is clear that the latter, though not more convenient for the original purpose, is far richer in possible implications beyond this purpose. Returning then to the context of my argument, I shall nail down as my first result to have\u00b7established and clearly identified a surplus of meaning contained in a scientific theory beyond its explicit predictions, This non explicit surplus consists in the anticipatory powers of the theory which it exercises by its general outline and appearance. This appearance appeals to the imagination of future minds and invites them to explore its possible ,\u00b7rider im- plications. It suggests problems to them that lead to future dis~ coveries. Since a precise positivist interpretation of a scientific</p>\n<p>9 theory insists on limiting its content to its explicit observa- tional predictions (this being indeed the very essence of the posi- tivist idea) it necessarily ignores its anticipatory powers and reduces it thus to s&#x27;cerility. Dut before going further, I must yet enter a caveat,. .. ;, The dis- .: ., t~ :.\u2022 tinction between explicit content and informal heuristi,~-\u00a5g.qJiers is \u00b7. -\u00b7~ . profound, but not absolute, No mathematical formula mean[! anything except as understood by him who applies it, and such an act of &#x27; understanding and applying is necessarily informal. When I speak of the explicit content of a theory, I mean such applications of it which, though informal, are quite obvious. These I distinguish from the yet indeterminate meaning of the theory that may be re- \u00b7vealed only much later, by a creative act of a scientist 1s imagina- tion. Dut I have still to show, if I am to justify Copernicus, that in expressing his belief in the reality of the heliocentric sys- tern, as distinct from the Ptolemaean, he was in fact asserting the presence of its anticipatory powers, This is far from obvious,. since, for one thing, it is not clear how anticipatory powers can be known at all, It is clear that they cannot be explicitly !{no~m. Copernicus certainly did not knm~ that his system represented an aspect of Kepler I s lai\u00b7rn and of Newton I s theory of general gravi ta- t ion, Indeed, being wedded to an explanation of the planetary sys- / tern in terms of steady circular motions, he would have absolutely rejected Kepler&#x27;s Laws and Newton&#x27;s theory based on them. Yet, in my view, he did show that he had this knowledge and expressed it by his affirmation that his system was real. For he based this claim on the very features of the system which were to</p>\n<p>10 serve as clues to the problems of Kepler and Newton and lead to their discoveries. He gloried in the internal coherence of his system and felt particularly gratified by the regular increase of orbital periods with the increasing distance of the planets from . \u00b7! ~1?:~;:: .... -. the sun. He said that this orderliness was reasonabl,e ~.fld, ,elaimed that it was a unique quality of his system. .J~.i, l t. t\u00b7 He also trl&#x27;.fid&#x27; \u00b7to show that it was reasonable that the sun, as the sole provider of light to the universe, should be situated at its center. What he meant . \\ . . by asserting that the heliocentric system was real, must have in- cluded an anticipation of the fact that these features of his sys- tem; and perhaps others too, might yet serve as clues to future problems and that such problems may lead to yet unthinl,able further ... -~ ~ discoveries. &#x27;&gt;~.-- We shall see more clearly what Copernicus.meant, if we align him with his successors to whose purposes the reality of his system was even more essential than it ~,as to him. Tbe results of Copernicus would have remained valid and interesting, even if Osiander had been right in calling his theory a mere computing device, The followers of Copernicus were much more deeply com- mitted. The enquiries on which Kepler spent his life, would have been altogether non-sensical, if the-heliocentric system were not . . real, He elaborated the distinctive image of the Copernican system, basing himself on the belief that it represented a fact. Galileo.&lt; was of course equally involved, The hostility and danger which he faced, -added to the rislrn of his commitment, but a scientist pur- suing a solitary problem for years is hazarding his.existence as a scientist and this hazard is fearful enough by itself. The be- lief of Copernicus in the reality of his system thus acquired an</p>\n<p>11 overwhelming practical meaning for Kepler and Galileo in the form of their conviction that the problems suggested by the heliocentric image were good problems, pointing to important hidden truths. The manifest continuity between Copernicus\u00b71s b~:tri:t;~n the ~~ . -~ i~~;&quot;? reality of his system and the heuristic commitment of hi\\!i~f&gt;ollowers \u00b7 .. -~ .. leads me to conclude that their commitment was but an intensifica- tion of Copernicus&#x27;s belief. It demonstrates that his belief in \\ the reality of his system expressed the same kind of expectation which his followers expressed in embarking on their problems. The difference was mainly that his belief in the reality of his system was less dynamic and less pointed, than their belief in the sound- ness of their problems. De lief in t~e:;;eality of a theory entails the expectation that any of its statements or aspects may become a clue to new problems and discoveries. Then, ~hen this expecta- tion materialises and~new problems are discovered on these lines, these will entail more definite expectations of a hidden truth lying in a particular direction, and this expectation will lead to action in quest of the hidden truth. We may say that in rejecting Osiander 1s view that his theory was merely a new computing device, Copernicus vaguely anticipated the kind of concrete anticipations, called problems, which he evolrnd in Kepler, Galileo, and Newton. We can generalise this result. i&#x27;lhat Copernicus meant by at-/ tributing reality to his system, is but an instance of what is com- monly meant by saying that something is real and no mere figment of the mind. \\&#x27;/hen we say that an object is real, we mean that it will not dissolve like a dream, but that, for better or worse, it will yet manifest its existence, inexhaustibly. We feel that it is there, outside, whether we believe it or not, existing independently of</p>\n<p>12 us, and hence never fully predictable in its consequences, I propose to define reality and truth, accordingly, as follows. If anything is believed to be capable of a largely indeterminate range of future manifestations it is thus believed t.6:,;p.e .real. A \u00b7\u00b7. -\u00b7-.\u2022~\u00b7- ., ~t ,:, statement about nature is believed to be true if it is iqeJ!-ieved . \u2022 .. \u20221~--.,,. , .. \u00b7 .. ., to disclose an aspect of something real in nature. A true physical theory is, therefore, no mere functional relation between pointer . &#x27; readings, out represents an aspect of a reality, which may yet manifest itself inexhaustibly in the future. I agree therefore with positivism in the view that if a scientific theory could be reduced to a bare functional relation \u00b7 between obse:i:-vable facts, it would \u00b7have no bearing on reality nor claim to be true; but I deny that such a functional relation can constitute a scientific theory. The difference between the scope of a statement that is only explicitly grounded and one that is claimed to be true, is shown in the deductive sciences. According to Godel 1s famous theorem, a sentence which says of itself that it is not demonstrable merely reflects on its origins, while a sentence which says of itself that it is not true, can be shOl&#x27;m to be\u00b7 self-contradictory. The reason is that by contrast to explicit demonstration, the establishment of truth entails an unlimited commitment, Dut we have still to show the ultimate grounds on which such unlimited commitments are entered upon. We may still ask why the internal harmony of the heliocentric system made Copernicus and his followers believe that it was real. The clue to the answer, and in- deed most of the answer itself, may be found in the fact that the existence of a ha~monious order is a denial of randomness. Some-</p>\n<p>-\u00b7 13 thing that is random is meaningless, and, by contrast, anything that is orderly, is meaningful. Take the difference between a tune and a noise .. Or, more generally, between a message and a noise. Communic_a_tion theory \u00b7: )~~-.;.:-t.,41P._:, def~nes a noise, by contrast to any as a random sequence and says that, distinctive seri\u2022es 0cff;:signals, J ,.. -l&#x27; . , :~~;jt-.;. t.., as such, noise conv~ys no in- formation, means nothing. This shows that order is strictly com- plementarY&#x27;,to randomness; each starts where the other ends and each . &#x27;\u2022 can be conceived only as the denial of the other. There is a very import&quot;ant difference in the identifiability of an ordered sequence as compared with a noise\u00b7. Any single message is represented ideal- ly by only one configuration of signals, while for a noise the very ... opposite holds. No significance musf \u00b7,be attached to any particular configuration of signals that are a mere noise. We must indis- &#x27; criminately identify any particular configuration of a noise, with any other configurat:fon of them. And this is true of any random aggregate: the chance events which compose it could have as well happened otherwise. Dy contrast, once we have recognised an ag- gregate as orderly an,;! meaningful, we cannot think that it might just as 1\u00b71ell have happened differently. It is deemed an identifi- able thing, possessing reality in the sense I have defined it, name- ly that, being real, it may yet manifest itself inexhaustibly in the future. &lt;&#x27; To distinguish meaningful patterns from random ag- \u00b7 gregates is therefore rightly described as the power for structur- ing reality. Our capacity for discerning meaningful aggregates as distinct from chance aggregates is an ultimate power of personal judgment. It can be aided by explicit argument but never determined by it.</p>\n<p>14 The final decision will always remain tacit. Such a distinction may of course be so obvious, that our tacit powers are used effort- lessly and their use remains unnoticed. Our eyes and ears make such decisions almost automatically for us. Dut dec:Uq;.9,,11.s, of this . . ~\u00b7\u00b7 ~_:: ;;, kind may be hard and momentous. A jury may be presenteq, 1j:\\i:j.):;h a . :-: \u00b7~r~-&#x27; pattern of circumstantial evidence pointing to the accuse.a. It is always conceivable that this pattern may be due to chance. Just I how unlikely a chance should they admit as possible? What degree of coincidence should be deemed to be quite unbelievable? The prisoner&#x27;s life will depend on the decision, and there is no rule by which this can be decided. Admittedly, rules for setting a\u00b7 limit to the improbability of chances which a scientist might properly assume to have ociurred have been widely accepted among scientists. nut.these rules have no other foundation than a vague feeling for what a scientist may regard as an unreasonable chance. The late Enrico Fermi is re- ported to have said that a miracle is an\u00b7 event the chances of 1Ihich are less than one in ten, The rule which R, A. Fisher in his book, The Design of Experiments, has made widely current is a little more cautious; it rejects as illusory only patterns for which the odds of having been formed by chance is less than one in tl&#x27;lenty. Dut if anyone were to suggest that the limit should be set at one in / five or at one in two hundred, nothing more could be said against this than that it does not seem reasonable. Such decisions will also greatly depend on the kind .of connec- tions we deem plausible on gene1\u2022a1 grounds. We shall accept much less substantial evidence for plausible patterns or regularities than we would require for connections which we consider highly im-</p>\n<p>15 probable. Kepler has put forward along with his three laws, and just as triumphantly, other regularities in the Solar system which we brush aside today, for we no longer believe that that kind of connection could be real. A curious numerical lawq;o.v..erning the .- &#x27;.,. -;:.~!._. spacing of the planets, usually known for about two centuries. described as Dode Is L&lt;J.,llf...- ,has been . \u00b7 .. \u00b7,:~ .. &#x27; .. -~ Long since discredited:,. it was recently given currency once more by C. F. von Weizsacl(er, for he thought he.had an explanation for it. A very substantial body of evidence which I produced abo\u00b5t 50 years for my theory of the ad- sorption of gases on solids, was brushed aside soon after its publi- cation, because the theory which this evidence supported was found incompatible with the electrical- structure of matter as discovered ?~. . by Dohr, Debye and the Draggs. Later when Fritz London, late of this university, revised this view of molecular forces on the grounds of the new quantum mechanics, the evidence became once more acceptable, while other experimentai evidence--put forward by no less a man than Irving Langmuir--1\u2022Ihich-had supported the previously held view concerning molecular forces, now turned out to be er- roneous. I have reported this story in the September 13th issue of Science, published in Washington. I have said that reality in nature was something that persists outside and may yet manifest itself inexhaustibly, far beyond our ;&#x27; .. &#x27;6 present ken. Something must be added to this description, if the pursuit of natural science is to be justified. Consider that the Copernican revolution was but a continuation of a structuring that had its origins in antiquity. Copernicus deepened and beautifully clarified a coherence transmitted by Ptolemy. imd this triumph pointed beyond itself in the mind of Copernicus himself. In Kepler,</p>\n<p>16 passionately embracing the system of Copernicus, its image evoked anew the same kind of creative hunger which Copernicus had satisfied by discovering it. And still the presence of yet hidden truth worked its way ever further. To Newton, Kepler&#x27;s .,l&lt;l-WS appeared in- , ~\u00b7 :&#x27;&#x27;!&#x27;&quot;&#x27;~~--~- ., .. -.. ~- \u00b7., coherent and he responded by developing the theory of !\u00a7:eTf!ral &#x27;\u00b7: \u20221~ ....... ~ gravitation in which Kepler&#x27;s three laws were.Jointly \u00b7derived .from the me.chanics o.f Galileo. Nor was this the end, for a quarter of a millenni.~ later, Einstein was to find unsatis.fying the relation o.f the Newtonian system to the electromagnetic theory of light and to discover an even deeper coherence to reconcile the two. The continued pursuit o.f science is possible, because the structure of nature and the capac~ty of the human mind to grasp .... - this structure, are .frequently such \u00b7a:ti is exemplified by this se- quence of discoveries during the past two thousand years. It seems .frequently to be the case that nature is capable o.f being grasped in successive stages; each of v1hich can be reached only by the high- est powers of the human mind. Consequently, to discover a true coherence in nature is in general not only to discern something which by the mere .fact of being real, necessarily points beyond it- sel.f, but to anticipate that future discoveries may prove such reality to be far deeper still than our present thought. can an- ticipate. ,&gt; It may sound strange that I insist on a belie.fin the reality o.f theoretical suppositions as the driving force to discovery. It would seem a conservative conviction rather than a source of innova- tion. The positivist view of science would claim that the major discoveries of modern physics were based on a sceptical attitude towards the framework of hitherto accepted scienti.fic theories. The</p>\n<p>17 discovery of relativity involved the abandonment of the current con- ceptions of space and time and quantum mechanics achieved its break- through by discarding the planetary system of electrons circling the nucleus from which Niels Dohr had derived the th~9ry of atomic . \u00b7::_-&lt;&#x27;!&#x27;&quot;&quot;-:-,-;~~ spectra. Einstein himself acknowledged that Mach&#x27;s posi,fiv.:tst &#x27;:~\\~.:. ~., philosophy inspired his work and Heisenberg I s quantum me\u00b7chanics was deliberately framed to reduce atomic theory to a functional rela- \\ tion of observable quantities. It was with this in mind that one spoke of the modern epistemological method in science . . These facts seem to contradict my thesis, but I think they will fall into line with it, if I first make clearer the opposite ex- treme of creative procedure, based on .a firm belief in the reality . \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7~~ of the current framework of scientific theory. We may recognise the prototype of such a feat in the discovery of America by Colum- bus. He triumphed by taking literally, and as guide to action, that the earth was round, which his contemporaries held vaguely and as a mere matter of speculation. The egg of Columbus is the proverbial symbol for such breath-taking originality guided by a crudely concrete imagihation. I remember having the same feeling when first hearing of Einstein&#x27;s theory of Drownian motion. The idea that the meandering motion of small floating particles seen under the microscope, should show us the impact of molecules knock- &gt; ing them about in accordance with the equations by which Doltzman\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 and Maxwell had derived the kinetic theory of gases, impressed me as grossly incongruous--like something out of science fiqtion. I had the same kind of feeling that I was listening to something grossly fantastic, when I heard Elsasser suggesting (in 1925) that certain anomalies observed in the scattering of electrons by solids</p>\n<p>18 may be due to the optical interference of their de Droglie waves. He had all heard of the waves since 1923, yet were astounded by the fact that they could be taken literally as Elsasser did. This may remind us that the first great move towards the dis- \u00b7:jt~;;-t;, .. ~, cover~ of quantum mechanics was de Droglie 1s idea of the41&#x27;ave nature . . }~f ~ v\u00b7 of matter. This revolutionary idea and Schrodinger Is de&#x27;ve)&#x27;;pment .. of it into wave mechanics, shows no trace of any positivistic in- fluences-. J.dd to this that Max Planck, the founder of quantum .. theory was an active opponent of Mach&#x27;s analysis of science and dis- sented also-from Heisenberg&#x27;s claim of basing physical theories on directly observable quantities, It appears then that the pre-domi- nant principle that shaped modern Ph,~sical theory was not the posi- tivist program but the transition from\u00b7\u00b7a mechanical conception of reality to a mathematical conception of it, which sometimes coin- cided with positivistic aims. We can bring then-the revolution of the twentieth century into line with the Copernican revolution of t_he 16th and 17th century. They both consisted in a decisive deepening of coherence with a simultaneous extension&quot;of its range. The modern re~olution differed from its precursor in establishing mathematical harmonies in place of beautiful mechanical systems .. The mathematical image of reality is more abstract than the mechanical but its capacity to point beyond its immediate predictive content is similar to that of the mechanical image. The idea that the wave nature of particles postulated by de Droglie could be con- firmed by diffraction experiments came as a fantastic surprise to physicists. The discovery of the positron came about just as unex- pectedly to confirm a prediction contained unnoticed by its author</p>\n<p>19 in a mathematical theory of Dirac. Generally speaking, the trans- formation of modern physics started with the discovery of quantum theory by Planck in 1900 and continued after that by a series of attempts to restore the coherence of the this discovery.

It was in the course of this enterprise that mathematical beauty manifestly became a guide to discovery and was recognised as the final token of truth. Paul Dirac has repeatedly observed this fact. My account of the Copernican revolution and of the modern revolution in physics has mentioned only in passing the contribu- tions made by new experimental observations. Dut the examples I have given were typical of the way experiments\u00b7duripg this period often followed the theoretical anticipation of them, the connection being often not recognized at first. Theoretical speculation and experimental probing entered Jointly into a persistent quest towards an ever wider and deeper coherence. \u00b7 This remark brings up the question, how the actual process of discovery is performed. Much has\u00b7been written about this with which I disagree, but I can put my own views only quite summarily at this stage. To see a good problem is to see something hidden and yet/ accessible. This is done by integrating some raw experiences into clues pointing to a gap, To undertake a problem is to corrmit one- self to the belief that you can fill in this gap and make thereby a new contact with reality. Such a commitment must be passionate. A problem which does not worry us and the prospects of which do not excite us is not a problem; it does not exist. A problem is</p>\n<p>20 discerned by integrating bits of experience to a fragmentary pat- tern which, if completed, \\&#x27;Till touch upon reality. Completion, which solves the problem, is achieved by a sustained quest for deeper coherence. Every move towards this aim is pr?i~pt,eg, by an . - ~~ : . , .., I ; \u00b7: ~ ;, intense desire evoked and guided by a sense of approachijlj;Jdis - covery. Such is the dynamic form of the anticipatory powers seen before \\ in a historical perspective. Without them no research can succeed; cannot even be said to take place. \u00b7Natural ability for discerning the incipient coherence of things and sen~ing the direction towards deeper coherence, varies &#x27;to about the same extent among men\u00b7 as. aoe~ the ability for boxing, . \u00b7,.,~ . ballet dancing or playing chess. Theories of discovery which off&#x27;er no decisive role to scientific genius have no bearing on discovery. This is true also for theories in which hypotheses arise unaccount- ably and are entertained for no better reason than to try everything once. Nor is it true that we could sele.ct from such hypotheses those which are false by letting them be knocked out by a fact which \u2022 contradicts them. Any contradictory evidence can be Judged only within the context of the quest; Judgment must ultimately depend on our sense of approaching coherence. tions cannot produce a discovery. In any case, ulterior refuta- The dynamics of discovery are brought into action by committing ourselves to certain anticipations. Without such commitment no supporting evidence will turn up; no failure to find such evidence will be felt; no conclusions will be drawn and tested; no quest will take place. Evidence can be mobilised only by a surmise, which being a vision of the truth we are after, necessarily seeks its own</p>\n<p>21 confirmation. Such commitment exposes us to possible failure, but to risk failure is not to aim at it. To say that in this process we are seeking the refutation of the hypothesis we are entertaining, as K. R. Popper often says, is misleading.

The triumph _of coherence achieved by the Copernican Revolution filled those brought up in the Medieval tradition with dismay. The earth&#x27;s central position had been the ~ symbol of man&#x27;s destiny as the only thinking, morally responsible being in the universe. The providential-meaning of nature, which had confirmed man in the ordering of his life, was lost in the new, symbolically meaningless image of the universe. &quot;It is all in pieces, all coherence gone&quot;, wrote John Donne already_in 1611. This conflict has steadily widened up to this day. The destruc- tion of the ancient cosmic hierarchy has spread into a theoretical ,, denial of all higher forms of existence. The ultimate components of things, including those that make up man and his thoughts were all placed on an identical level of being. Just as the harmonies of Copernicus disappear in the Neutonian equations and become mere ac- cidental formations of them, so must all complex entities now be re- duced to the law governing their components.

    "content_text": "The Metaphysical Reach of Science \nby Michael Polanyi \n(As delivered on February 10, 1964 at Duke University) \nMy subject.today will be the positivist theory of science \n., ;-1?_;' \u2022 \njudged. on the evidence of a historical controversy, fought out\nat \nthe very dawn of science over the system of Copernicus . . r,ilf:' \n.. \u00b7~ \n. \nRumours of his theory that the earth moves round the 'sun, had \nbeen current since 1515, twenty eight years before he published it \n' '\u00b7 \nin De Revolutionibus Orbium Celestium just before his death in 1543. \nTwo years before this, in 1541, he received a latter from a Luther-\nan minister in Nuremberg, named Andreas Osiander, urging him not \nto regard his theory as true, but merely as a hypothesis, suitable \nto serve as a foundation for calcuia.t.ions. \nAnd when the book came \n' .. -,\\ \nout, it was prefaced by an Advice to the Reader, generally attri-\nbuted to Osiander, in which he elaborated his warnings. \nHe wrote \nthat astronomy cannot B:_,rrive at the truth for it ignores the causes \nof stellar motion; it should only propose hypotheses in accordance \n.\u2022. \nwith observations and these hypotheses need not be true nor even \nprobable. \nThis view coincides substantially with the positivist theory \nof Ernst Mach, which regards science as a convenient functional re-\nlation between observed data. This theory purports to exclude all \nmetaphysical claims of science by restricting it to the formulation0\u2022 \nof functional relations between observed data. \nWe shall see that \nthis intention was also present, though with an altogether differ-\nent cotive, in the intervention of Osiander. \nTo this intervention Copernicus replied in the First Dook of \nhis volume by claiming that his system was true for it had symme-\nI \n\n\" \ntries, and harmonies exclusively its .01\u00b7m. \nThe orders and magnitudes of all stars and \nspheres \u2022\u2022. become so bound together that \nnothing in any part thereof could be moved \nfrom its place without producing confusion \nin all other parts, and of the universe as \na whole. \n.-\n\u00b7t)~?-~ ~-~.:i \nThis refers to the way major epicycles of Ptolemy ap~,re-\n, \n. \n,. .,, . 1t \n2 \n. \n':-'\\\u00b5,~ ! ., \nplaced by a pattern of suitably spaced circular orbits centering \non the sun. \nThe planet is observed at different points moving east~1ards \n'\u00b7 \nagainst the firmament of fixed stars. \nDut not steadily.

It was enhanced further by the harmonious sequence of or-\nbital periods nou apparent for all six planets, the earth being \nplaced among them. \n(See table), \nOsiander had attacl<ed the claims of Copernicus on the grounds \n\n3 \nthat science could no more than save the phenomena by a suitable \nhypothesis, which need not be true, nor even probable. \nThis attaclc \nwas continued later against the Copernicans. \nGalileo was attacked \non these grounds and put on trial by Pope Urban the VIIIth. \nOn \nbehalf of the Roman church, Cardinal Dellarmine pressed him to ac-\nknoWl!::!dge \n\u00b7ri;~::;.:,:., __ . \nthat the heliocentric system was but a coniput;tl'.ig, .device, \n\" \nbut Galileo resisted this. \nI .. \n_' . :_ ,t, \nI have said that Osiander I i'lt'tack on \nthe views\u00b7of Copernicus coincides with the positivist view that a \nscientific,theory is but a convenient description of observed facts. \n. \n... \n. \nThe coincidence of these two historically remote positions was \nborne out earlier in this century by a leading positivist writer, \nPaui Duhem, who declared that it was Cardinal Dellarmine and \nOsiander and not Galileo and Kepler who had grasped the precise \nsignificance of the experimental methog. \nI \nHenri Poincare too con-\ndemned the \"residual metaphysics\" to which Galileo was adhering. \nDut the grounds on which the clergy attacked Copernicanism \nwere quite different from those on which the positivists objected \nto it. The clergy defended the medieval view, formulated by \nAquinas, that empirical astronomy cannot speak of metaphysical re-\nality. It defended the privilege of philosophic reason to speak \nof reality against encroachment by science. \nThe positivists re-\njected, on the contrary, any met~physical statements.as empty and \nconfusing, and aimed at purifying science from any such claims. \nThey demanded that science should refrain from claiming to be true-\nor to be bearing on reality. \nThe position of the two different attacks on Copernicanism \ncan be illustrated by a diagram. \nThe medieval position shows rea-\nson bearing metaphysically on reality, while barring science from \n\n,, \n4 \nsuch bearing. \nThe positivist position is shown isolating science \nboth from reason and reality, self contained in strict empiricism. \nCopernicanism is sho.wn, thirdly, claiming to exercise reason \nthrough science with a bearing on reality. \nDI,\\GRAMS \n\u00b7t):,S:-_ .. ; \nIn this three cornered dispute I shall side witJi,,..t~, Coperni-\ncans\"; I agree with the posit:tvists in pointing out that:'~fu~ Coper-\nnicans were making metaphysical claims, but I side against them \nby agreeing with the medievalists, that such claims are not empty \n\\ \nbut, on the contrary, essential to all true knowledge. \nSeen in \nthis light, the medievalists were right, in recognising empirical \nscience as encroaching on their domain, but wrong in contesting \nthat science was competent to do so. \nThe Copernicans\u00b7were right \nin every respect. \nThe difficulty in meeting the positivist criticism of Coperni-\ncanism lies in the fact that there is such an obvious answer to it, \nnamely, that the Copernicans were right, because the earth does in \n~ \nfact go round the sun. \nDut, of course, Duhem and ?oincare could \nnot have overlool{ed this fact. \nThey must have meant that Kepler \nand Galileo were wrong, and Copernicus himself even more wrong, in \nasserting this fact on the grounds of evidence which could be rep-\nresented also by an earth centered system. \nTo this we may obJect that Kepler and Galileo--though not \nCopernicus--had one strong reason for asserting the reality of the,.. \nheliocentric system. \nThey may have felt that it must be real, \nsince it l'las by relying on the Copernican system to be real, that \nthey had made their own great discoveries. \nDut we must ask vhether any such feeling could possibly be \n\n5 \njustified. If we are to accept the connection to be other than \naccidental, we must see clear1y how the Copernican system could \nexercise such heuristic powers, which the Ptolemaic system would \nlack. \nThe first point to note in this connection is,~ful.t,, .. ,Qopernicus \n.. \n, ..... : : , \nand his followers clearly felt a deficiency\u00b7 in thei; s;~t~fu which \n\u2022 \u00b7, \u20221; ..... \n~hey tried to remedy. \nThey felt that there must be some good rea-\nson for the central position of the sun l\"lith the planets going \n. \n\\ \nround it. \u00b7\u00b7-Copernicus argued that the sun as giver of all light \nmust be the center of the Universe. \nKepler insisted on the natural \npre_-eminence of the sun and came near the truth by assuming that \nthe sun emits a motive spirit (anima motrix) which keeps the plan-\nets going round. \nThus the problem\u00b7wa-s kept open and alive until \nNewton solved it by the discovery of general gravitation .. \nThis shows how Copernicus and his followers were guided by \n' \nthe heliocentric system to their enquiries. \nThey pursued the prob-\nlems suggested by a Copernican layout of the Universe. \nKepler's \nThird Law, relating the square of planetary periods inversely to \nthe cube of planetary distances from the_ sun, also elaborated a \nproblem set by Copernicus, by observing how orbital periods steadi-\nly increase with the planet's distance from the sun. \nThe First and \nSecond Laws introducing the elliptic paths, with the sun in one \nfocus\u00b7of them, could hardly have been conceived by anyone who ig-\n/ \nnored the heliocentric system; for it made no sense in the Ptole-\nmaic system. \ni\\nd it was of course Kepler's laus, combined 1\u00b71ith \nfindings of Galileo, that set Newton his task and prepared his tri-\numph, \nVle can take it as a fact then that the Copernican system did \n\n6 \nindicate good problems which were not visib.le in the Ptolemaic \nsystem. \nLet us no\\'1 try to identify the process by which Coperni-\ncanism suggested such good problems. \nThis brings up an awl<ward question, which to my knowledge, has \nnever been systematically examined, \n'l.'he questioi'l-Tu.:...,, What is a \n\u00b7,,\u00b7 \n\u2666 . .,..~ \u2022\u2022\u2022 f \n...,-.,. \nproblem? \nNot the kind of problem set to students o;f};1~thematics or \n'-.. \nto chemists in practical classes but a scientific problem the solu-\ntion of \\\u00b7rhich is unlmown; the l<ind of problem a scientist embarks \non with a reasonable hope to discover something new that will be \n\\ '\u2022 \nworth the labour and expenses of the search for it. \nI would answer that to have such a problem, a good problem, \nis to surmise the presence of something hidden, and yet possibly \naccessible, lying in a certain oireqtion. \nA gooo problem--let me \nrepeat--is a surmise of something h.1dclen yet accessible by an en-\nquiry in a certain direction. \nSuch a surmise\u00b7is evoked in the \nimagination of a scientist by a set of circumstances which come to \nbe seen as clues to a hioden thing. \nWhen the problem is solved, \nthese clues will seem to form part of the hidden thing that is \nnow discovered, \nThe clL.tes of a problem thus anticipate parts or \naspects of a future discovery. \nThe heliocentric system of Copernicus could raise a problem \nto be answered by the discovery of general gravitation because it \nwas itself an aspect of the theory of general gravitation; and the,; \nsame is true of Kepler 1s discoveries which lay on the way to \nNewton 1s work. \nCopernicus anticipated important aspects of Kep-\nler's three\u00b71aws. \nThe anticipations contained in the heliocentric theory are \nsharply distinct from its explicit predictions. \nThe celestial \n\n7 \ntimetable set out by Copernicus was not markedly different from \nthat of Ptolemy. \nClose on to a century and a half following the \ndeath of Copernicus all efforts to discriminate between the two \nsystems on the grounds of their observable quantitative predic-\ntions have failed. \n1'/hile the discoveries of Keplei-.:;;a~, Galileo \n\u00b7~ \n~rt.;-' \nba~ed on the heliocentric system greatly increased it_~_.p:-i'ausibility, \n. ' \u00b7~ \na medieval thinker like Delarmine \nand such distinguished scien-\ntists of our 01-m days, as Duhem anci Poinca.re, from a. positivist \npoint. of ,View, could still regard the factual content of the two \n'\u00b7 \n. \nrival-system as having been identical, \nAnd they were right. \nFaced with this fact we may as!{ once more, How can one of' two \nsystems having the same predictive content, so vastly exceed the \nother in its anticipations? The ansr1er is given already in what \nI have just. described in detail. \nTh~-\u2022 a_nticipatory powers of the \nCopernican system lay in the new image by which it represented the \n' \npredictive content of the Ptolemaic system. \nIt is in the appear-\nance of the new system that lay its immense superiority; it is \nthis image that originated the Copernican revolution. \nI am drawing here a distinction which will prove decisive. I \ndistinguish between the precise predictive content of a mathemati-\ncal theory consisting in a functional relation of measured vari-\nables and a meaning of the theory which goes beyond this. \nWhile \nthese functional relations remain the same, whatever symbols are ;-\nused for presenting them, the surplus of meaning which goes beyond \nthis depends on the appearance of the theory. \nThe way this may come about can be illustrated from everyday \nlife. \nSuppose \\'Te have a list of all the towns of England, each \nwith its precise longitude and latitude, and the number of its in-\n\n8 \nhabitants, and we represent these data in a map, each town being \nmarked by a circle corresponding to it in size. \nThe mapping of \nthe list adds .no new data to it, yet it conveys a far better under-\nstanding of these data. It reveals for example the 1~-~ the popula-\n. \n-\u00b7.-~-, . \u00b7-;j-~! i.' \ntion\".is distributed through the country and suggests Cl;tJ~~t_ions \nabout the reasons of physical geography and history wh1qh will ac-\ncount for this distribution. \nThe map will guide the imagination \n\\ \nto enter on fruitful enquiries to which the original list v10uld \nleave us blind. \nWe can, in fact, give a fairly close analogy between the \nPtolemaic and the Copernican system in such terms. \nSuppose you \nare interested only in a certain number of itineraries. \nThey could \n. , .. \" \n. \nbe conveniently represented separately ~n several lines. \nYou some-\ntimes find this kind of indication in guide bo.ol<s; \nDut the travel-\nler may use instead a map on which he can trace the itineraries \nfor himself. \nThe first representation corresponds to the Ptolemaic, \nthe second to the Copernican system, \nIt is clear that the latter, \nthough not more convenient for the original purpose, is far richer \nin possible implications beyond this purpose. \nReturning then to the context of my argument, I shall nail \ndown as my first result to have\u00b7established and clearly identified \na surplus of meaning contained in a scientific theory beyond its \nexplicit predictions, \nThis non explicit surplus consists in the \nanticipatory powers of the theory which it exercises by its general \noutline and appearance. \nThis appearance appeals to the imagination \nof future minds and invites them to explore its possible ,\u00b7rider im-\nplications. It suggests problems to them that lead to future dis~ \ncoveries. \nSince a precise positivist interpretation of a scientific \n\n9 \ntheory insists on limiting its content to its explicit observa-\ntional predictions (this being indeed the very essence of the posi-\ntivist idea) it necessarily ignores its anticipatory powers and \nreduces it thus to s'cerility. \nDut before going further, I must yet enter a caveat,. .. ;, The dis-\n.: \n., \nt~ :.\u2022 \ntinction between explicit content and informal heuristi,~-\u00a5g.qJiers is \n\u00b7. -\u00b7~ \n. \nprofound, but not absolute, \nNo mathematical formula mean[! anything \nexcept as understood by him who applies it, and such an act of \n' \nunderstanding and applying is necessarily informal. \nWhen I speak \nof the explicit content of a theory, I mean such applications of \nit which, though informal, are quite obvious. \nThese I distinguish \nfrom the yet indeterminate meaning of the theory that may be re-\n\u00b7vealed only much later, by a creative act of a scientist 1s imagina-\ntion. \nDut I have still to show, if I am to justify Copernicus, that \nin expressing his belief in the reality of the heliocentric sys-\ntern, as distinct from the Ptolemaean, he was in fact asserting the \npresence of its anticipatory powers, \nThis is far from obvious,. \nsince, for one thing, it is not clear how anticipatory powers can \nbe known at all, It is clear that they cannot be explicitly !{no~m. \nCopernicus certainly did not knm~ that his system represented an \naspect of Kepler I s lai\u00b7rn and of Newton I s theory of general gravi ta-\nt ion, \nIndeed, being wedded to an explanation of the planetary sys-\n/ \ntern in terms of steady circular motions, he would have absolutely \nrejected Kepler's Laws and Newton's theory based on them. \nYet, in my view, he did show that he had this knowledge and \nexpressed it by his affirmation that his system was real. \nFor he \nbased this claim on the very features of the system which were to \n\n10 \nserve as clues to the problems of Kepler and Newton and lead to \ntheir discoveries. \nHe gloried in the internal coherence of his \nsystem and felt particularly gratified by the regular increase of \norbital periods with the increasing distance of the planets from \n. \n\u00b7! ~1?:~;:: .... -. \nthe sun. \nHe said that this orderliness was reasonabl,e ~.fld, ,elaimed \nthat it was a unique quality of his system. \n.J~.i, l t. t\u00b7 \nHe also trl'.fid' \u00b7to show \nthat it was reasonable that the sun, as the sole provider of light \nto the universe, should be situated at its center. \nWhat he meant \n. \n\\ \n. \n. \nby asserting that the heliocentric system was real, must have in-\ncluded an anticipation of the fact that these features of his sys-\ntem; and perhaps others too, might yet serve as clues to future \nproblems and that such problems may lead to yet unthinl,able further \n... -~ \n~ \ndiscoveries. \n'>~.--\nWe shall see more clearly what Copernicus.meant, if we align \nhim with his successors to whose purposes the reality of his system \nwas even more essential than it ~,as to him. \nTbe results of \nCopernicus would have remained valid and interesting, even if \nOsiander had been right in calling his theory a mere computing \ndevice, \nThe followers of Copernicus were much more deeply com-\nmitted. \nThe enquiries on which Kepler spent his life, would have \nbeen altogether non-sensical, if the-heliocentric system were not \n. \n. \nreal, \nHe elaborated the distinctive image of the Copernican system, \nbasing himself on the belief that it represented a fact. \nGalileo.< \nwas of course equally involved, \nThe hostility and danger which he \nfaced, -added to the rislrn of his commitment, but a scientist pur-\nsuing a solitary problem for years is hazarding his.existence as \na scientist and this hazard is fearful enough by itself. The be-\nlief of Copernicus in the reality of his system thus acquired an \n\n11 \noverwhelming practical meaning for Kepler and Galileo in the form \nof their conviction that the problems suggested by the heliocentric \nimage were good problems, pointing to important hidden truths. \nThe manifest continuity between Copernicus\u00b71s b~:tri:t;~n the \n~~ \n. \n-~ i~~;\"? \nreality of his system and the heuristic commitment of hi\\!i~f>ollowers \n\u00b7 .. -~ .. \nleads me to conclude that their commitment was but an intensifica-\ntion of Copernicus's belief. It demonstrates that his belief in \n\\ \nthe reality of his system expressed the same kind of expectation \nwhich his followers expressed in embarking on their problems. \nThe \ndifference was mainly that his belief in the reality of his system \nwas less dynamic and less pointed, than their belief in the sound-\nness of their problems. \nDe lief in t~e:;;eality of a theory entails \nthe expectation that any of its statements or aspects may become \na clue to new problems and discoveries. \nThen, ~hen this expecta-\ntion materialises and~new problems are discovered on these lines, \nthese will entail more definite expectations of a hidden truth \nlying in a particular direction, and this expectation will lead to \naction in quest of the hidden truth. \nWe may say that in rejecting \nOsiander 1s view that his theory was merely a new computing device, \nCopernicus vaguely anticipated the kind of concrete anticipations, \ncalled problems, which he evolrnd in Kepler, Galileo, and Newton. \nWe can generalise this result. \ni'lhat Copernicus meant by at-/ \ntributing reality to his system, is but an instance of what is com-\nmonly meant by saying that something is real and no mere figment of \nthe mind. \n\\'/hen we say that an object is real, we mean that it will \nnot dissolve like a dream, but that, for better or worse, it will \nyet manifest its existence, inexhaustibly. \nWe feel that it is there, \noutside, whether we believe it or not, existing independently of \n\n12 \nus, and hence never fully predictable in its consequences, \nI propose to define reality and truth, accordingly, as follows. \nIf anything is believed to be capable of a largely indeterminate \nrange of future manifestations it is thus believed t.6:,;p.e .real. \nA \n\u00b7\u00b7. -\u00b7-.\u2022~\u00b7-\n., \n~t ,:, \nstatement about nature is believed to be true if it is iqeJ!-ieved \n. \u2022 .. \u20221~--.,,. , .. \n\u00b7 .. ., \nto disclose an aspect of something real in nature. \nA true physical \ntheory is, therefore, no mere functional relation between pointer \n. \n' \nreadings, out represents an aspect of a reality, which may yet \nmanifest itself inexhaustibly in the future. \nI agree therefore with positivism in the view that if a \nscientific theory could be reduced to a bare functional relation \n\u00b7 between obse:i:-vable facts, it would \u00b7have no bearing on reality nor \nclaim to be true; but I deny that such a functional relation can \nconstitute a scientific theory. \nThe difference between the scope of a statement that is only \nexplicitly grounded and one that is claimed to be true, is shown \nin the deductive sciences. \nAccording to Godel 1s famous theorem, \na sentence which says of itself that it is not demonstrable merely \nreflects on its origins, while a sentence which says of itself that \nit is not true, can be shOl'm to be\u00b7 self-contradictory. \nThe reason \nis that by contrast to explicit demonstration, the establishment \nof truth entails an unlimited commitment, \nDut we have still to show the ultimate grounds on which such \nunlimited commitments are entered upon. \nWe may still ask why the \ninternal harmony of the heliocentric system made Copernicus and his \nfollowers believe that it was real. \nThe clue to the answer, and in-\ndeed most of the answer itself, may be found in the fact that the \nexistence of a ha~monious order is a denial of randomness. \nSome-\n\n-\u00b7 \n13 \nthing that is random is meaningless, and, by contrast, anything \nthat is orderly, is meaningful. \nTake the difference between a tune and a noise .. Or, more \ngenerally, between a message and a noise. \nCommunic_a_tion theory \n\u00b7: )~~-.;.:-t.,41P._:, \ndef~nes a noise, by contrast to any \nas a random sequence and says that, \ndistinctive seri\u2022es 0cff;:signals, \nJ ,.. \n-l' \n. \n, :~~;jt-.;. t.., \nas such, noise conv~ys no in-\nformation, means nothing. \nThis shows that order is strictly com-\nplementarY',to randomness; each starts where the other ends and each \n. \n'\u2022 \ncan be conceived only as the denial of the other. There is a very \nimport\"ant difference in the identifiability of an ordered sequence \nas compared with a noise\u00b7. \nAny single message is represented ideal-\nly by only one configuration of signals, while for a noise the very \n... \nopposite holds. \nNo significance musf \u00b7,be attached to any particular \nconfiguration of signals that are a mere noise. \nWe must indis-\n' \ncriminately identify any particular configuration of a noise, with \nany other configurat:fon of them. \nAnd this is true of any random \naggregate: the chance events which compose it could have as well \nhappened otherwise. \nDy contrast, once we have recognised an ag-\ngregate as orderly an,;! meaningful, we cannot think that it might \njust as 1\u00b71ell have happened differently. It is deemed an identifi-\nable thing, possessing reality in the sense I have defined it, name-\nly that, being real, it may yet manifest itself inexhaustibly in \nthe future. \n<' \nTo distinguish meaningful patterns from random ag-\n\u00b7 \ngregates is therefore rightly described as the power for structur-\ning reality. \nOur capacity for discerning meaningful aggregates as distinct \nfrom chance aggregates is an ultimate power of personal judgment. \nIt can be aided by explicit argument but never determined by it. \n\n14 \nThe final decision will always remain tacit. \nSuch a distinction \nmay of course be so obvious, that our tacit powers are used effort-\nlessly and their use remains unnoticed. \nOur eyes and ears make \nsuch decisions almost automatically for us. \nDut dec:Uq;.9,,11.s, of this \n. \n. ~\u00b7\u00b7 \n~_:: ;;, \nkind may be hard and momentous. \nA jury may be presenteq, 1j:\\i:j.):;h a \n. :-: \u00b7~r~-' \npattern of circumstantial evidence pointing to the accuse.a. It \nis always conceivable that this pattern may be due to chance. Just \nI \nhow unlikely a chance should they admit as possible? \nWhat degree \nof coincidence should be deemed to be quite unbelievable? The \nprisoner's life will depend on the decision, and there is no rule \nby which this can be decided. \nAdmittedly, rules for setting a\u00b7 limit to the improbability of \nchances which a scientist might properly assume to have ociurred \nhave been widely accepted among scientists. nut.these rules have \nno other foundation than a vague feeling for what a scientist may \nregard as an unreasonable chance. \nThe late Enrico Fermi is re-\nported to have said that a miracle is an\u00b7 event the chances of 1Ihich \nare less than one in ten, \nThe rule which R, A. Fisher in his book, \nThe Design of Experiments, has made widely current is a little more \ncautious; it rejects as illusory only patterns for which the odds \nof having been formed by chance is less than one in tl'lenty. \nDut \nif anyone were to suggest that the limit should be set at one in \n/ \nfive or at one in two hundred, nothing more could be said against \nthis than that it does not seem reasonable. \nSuch decisions will also greatly depend on the kind .of connec-\ntions we deem plausible on gene1\u2022a1 grounds. \nWe shall accept much \nless substantial evidence for plausible patterns or regularities \nthan we would require for connections which we consider highly im-\n\n15 \nprobable. \nKepler has put forward along with his three laws, and \njust as triumphantly, other regularities in the Solar system which \nwe brush aside today, for we no longer believe that that kind of \nconnection could be real. \nA curious numerical lawq;o.v..erning the \n.- '.,. -;:.~!._. \nspacing of the planets, usually \nknown for about two centuries. \ndescribed as Dode Is L<J.,llf...- ,has been \n. \u00b7 .. \u00b7,:~ .. ' \n.. -~ \nLong since discredited:,. it was \nrecently given currency once more by C. F. von Weizsacl(er, for he \nthought he.had an explanation for it. \nA very substantial body of \nevidence which I produced abo\u00b5t 50 years for my theory of the ad-\nsorption of gases on solids, was brushed aside soon after its publi-\ncation, because the theory which this evidence supported was found \nincompatible with the electrical- structure of matter as discovered \n?~. \n. \nby Dohr, Debye and the Draggs. \nLater when Fritz London, late of \nthis university, revised this view of molecular forces on the \ngrounds of the new quantum mechanics, the evidence became once more \nacceptable, while other experimentai evidence--put forward by no \nless a man than Irving Langmuir--1\u2022Ihich-had supported the previously \nheld view concerning molecular forces, now turned out to be er-\nroneous. \nI have reported this story in the September 13th issue \nof Science, published in Washington. \nI have said that reality in nature was something that persists \noutside and may yet manifest itself inexhaustibly, far beyond our \n;' .. \n'6 \npresent ken. \nSomething must be added to this description, if the \npursuit of natural science is to be justified. \nConsider that the \nCopernican revolution was but a continuation of a structuring that \nhad its origins in antiquity. \nCopernicus deepened and beautifully \nclarified a coherence transmitted by Ptolemy. \nimd this triumph \npointed beyond itself in the mind of Copernicus himself. \nIn Kepler, \n\n16 \npassionately embracing the system of Copernicus, its image evoked \nanew the same kind of creative hunger which Copernicus had satisfied \nby discovering it. \nAnd still the presence of yet hidden truth \nworked its way ever further. \nTo Newton, Kepler's .,l<l-WS appeared in-\n, ~\u00b7 :''!'\"'~~--~-\n., .. -.. ~-\n\u00b7., \ncoherent and he responded by developing the theory of !\u00a7:eTf!ral \n'\u00b7: \u20221~ ....... ~ \ngravitation in which Kepler's three laws were.Jointly \u00b7derived .from \nthe me.chanics o.f Galileo. \nNor was this the end, for a quarter of \na millenni.~ later, Einstein was to find unsatis.fying the relation \no.f the Newtonian system to the electromagnetic theory of light and \nto discover an even deeper coherence to reconcile the two. \nThe continued pursuit o.f science is possible, because the \nstructure of nature and the capac~ty of the human mind to grasp \n.... -\nthis structure, are .frequently such \u00b7a:ti is exemplified by this se-\nquence of discoveries during the past two thousand years. It seems \n.frequently to be the case that nature is capable o.f being grasped \nin successive stages; each of v1hich can be reached only by the high-\nest powers of the human mind. \nConsequently, to discover a true \ncoherence in nature is in general not only to discern something \nwhich by the mere .fact of being real, necessarily points beyond it-\nsel.f, but to anticipate that future discoveries may prove such \nreality to be far deeper still than our present thought. can an-\nticipate. \n,> \nIt may sound strange that I insist on a belie.fin the reality \no.f theoretical suppositions as the driving force to discovery. It \nwould seem a conservative conviction rather than a source of innova-\ntion. \nThe positivist view of science would claim that the major \ndiscoveries of modern physics were based on a sceptical attitude \ntowards the framework of hitherto accepted scienti.fic theories. The \n\n17 \ndiscovery of relativity involved the abandonment of the current con-\nceptions of space and time and quantum mechanics achieved its break-\nthrough by discarding the planetary system of electrons circling \nthe nucleus from which Niels Dohr had derived the th~9ry of atomic \n. \u00b7::_-<'!'\"\"-:-,-;~~ \nspectra. Einstein himself acknowledged that Mach's posi,fiv.:tst \n':~\\~.:. ~., \nphilosophy inspired his work and Heisenberg I s quantum me\u00b7chanics was \ndeliberately framed to reduce atomic theory to a functional rela-\n\\ \ntion of observable quantities. It was with this in mind that one \nspoke of the modern epistemological method in science . \n. These facts seem to contradict my thesis, but I think they will \nfall into line with it, if I first make clearer the opposite ex-\ntreme of creative procedure, based on .a firm belief in the reality \n. \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7~~ \nof the current framework of scientific theory. \nWe may recognise \nthe prototype of such a feat in the discovery of America by Colum-\nbus. \nHe triumphed by taking literally, and as guide to action, \nthat the earth was round, which his contemporaries held vaguely \nand as a mere matter of speculation. \nThe egg of Columbus is the \nproverbial symbol for such breath-taking originality guided by a \ncrudely concrete imagihation. \nI remember having the same feeling \nwhen first hearing of Einstein's theory of Drownian motion. \nThe \nidea that the meandering motion of small floating particles seen \nunder the microscope, should show us the impact of molecules knock-\n> \ning them about in accordance with the equations by which Doltzman\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 \nand Maxwell had derived the kinetic theory of gases, impressed me \nas grossly incongruous--like something out of science fiqtion. \nI \nhad the same kind of feeling that I was listening to something \ngrossly fantastic, when I heard Elsasser suggesting (in 1925) that \ncertain anomalies observed in the scattering of electrons by solids \n\n18 \nmay be due to the optical interference of their de Droglie waves. \nHe had all heard of the waves since 1923, yet were astounded by the \nfact that they could be taken literally as Elsasser did. \nThis may remind us that the first great move towards the dis-\n\u00b7:jt~;;-t;, .. ~, \ncover~ of quantum mechanics was de Droglie 1s idea of the41'ave nature \n. \n. \n}~f ~ v\u00b7 \nof matter. This revolutionary idea and Schrodinger Is de've)';pment \n.. \nof it into wave mechanics, shows no trace of any positivistic in-\nfluences-. \nJ.dd to this that Max Planck, the founder of quantum \n.. \ntheory was an active opponent of Mach's analysis of science and dis-\nsented also-from Heisenberg's claim of basing physical theories on \ndirectly observable quantities, It appears then that the pre-domi-\nnant principle that shaped modern Ph,~sical theory was not the posi-\ntivist program but the transition from\u00b7\u00b7a mechanical conception of \nreality to a mathematical conception of it, which sometimes coin-\ncided with positivistic aims. \nWe can bring then-the revolution of the twentieth century into \nline with the Copernican revolution of t_he 16th and 17th century. \nThey both consisted in a decisive deepening of coherence with a \nsimultaneous extension\"of its range. \nThe modern re~olution differed \nfrom its precursor in establishing mathematical harmonies in place \nof beautiful mechanical systems .. \nThe mathematical image of reality is more abstract than the \nmechanical but its capacity to point beyond its immediate predictive \ncontent is similar to that of the mechanical image. \nThe idea that \nthe wave nature of particles postulated by de Droglie could be con-\nfirmed by diffraction experiments came as a fantastic surprise to \nphysicists. \nThe discovery of the positron came about just as unex-\npectedly to confirm a prediction contained unnoticed by its author \n\n19 \nin a mathematical theory of Dirac. \nGenerally speaking, the trans-\nformation of modern physics started with the discovery of quantum \ntheory by Planck in 1900 and continued after that by a series of \nattempts to restore the coherence of the \nthis discovery. \nEach successive step in \nimage brut'a:1-4.y*,l.>roken by \n. \n.\u2022;' \n\u2022 -~~ :J \nthis process)vlil.$}'.antici-\n- :\u00b7 \npated in part by its antecedents and thus testified to its bearing \non reality far beyond its explicit content. It was in the course \nof this enterprise that mathematical beauty manifestly became a \nguide to discovery and was recognised as the final token of truth. \nPaul Dirac has repeatedly observed this fact. \nMy account of the Copernican revolution and of the modern \nrevolution in physics has mentioned only in passing the contribu-\ntions made by new experimental observations. \nDut the examples I \nhave given were typical of the way experiments\u00b7duripg this period \noften followed the theoretical anticipation of them, the connection \nbeing often not recognized at first. \nTheoretical speculation and \nexperimental probing entered Jointly into a persistent quest towards \nan ever wider and deeper coherence. \n\u00b7 This remark brings up the question, how the actual process of \ndiscovery is performed. \nMuch has\u00b7been written about this with which \nI disagree, but I can put my own views only quite summarily at this \nstage. \nTo see a good problem is to see something hidden and yet/ \naccessible. \nThis is done by integrating some raw experiences into \nclues pointing to a gap, \nTo undertake a problem is to corrmit one-\nself to the belief that you can fill in this gap and make thereby \na new contact with reality. \nSuch a commitment must be passionate. \nA problem which does not worry us and the prospects of which do \nnot excite us is not a problem; it does not exist. \nA problem is \n\n20 \ndiscerned by integrating bits of experience to a fragmentary pat-\ntern which, if completed, \\'Till touch upon reality. \nCompletion, \nwhich solves the problem, is achieved by a sustained quest for \ndeeper coherence. \nEvery move towards this aim is pr?i~pt,eg, by an \n. -\n~~ : . , \n.., \nI \n; \u00b7: \n~ ;, \nintense desire evoked and guided by a sense of approachijlj;Jdis -\ncovery. \nSuch is the dynamic form of the anticipatory powers seen before \n\\ \nin a historical perspective. \nWithout them no research can succeed; \ncannot even be said to take place. \n\u00b7Natural ability for discerning the incipient coherence of \nthings and sen~ing the direction towards deeper coherence, varies \n'to about the same extent among men\u00b7 as. aoe~ the ability for boxing, \n. \u00b7,.,~ \n. \nballet dancing or playing chess. \nTheories of discovery which off'er \nno decisive role to scientific genius have no bearing on discovery. \nThis is true also for theories in which hypotheses arise unaccount-\nably and are entertained for no better reason than to try everything \nonce. \nNor is it true that we could sele.ct from such hypotheses \nthose which are false by letting them be knocked out by a fact which \n\u2022 \ncontradicts them. \nAny contradictory evidence can be Judged only \nwithin the context of the quest; Judgment must ultimately depend on \nour sense of approaching coherence. \ntions cannot produce a discovery. \nIn any case, ulterior refuta-\nThe dynamics of discovery are brought into action by committing \nourselves to certain anticipations. \nWithout such commitment no \nsupporting evidence will turn up; no failure to find such evidence \nwill be felt; no conclusions will be drawn and tested; no quest \nwill take place. \nEvidence can be mobilised only by a surmise, which \nbeing a vision of the truth we are after, necessarily seeks its own \n\n21 \nconfirmation. \nSuch commitment exposes us to possible failure, but \nto risk failure is not to aim at it. To say that in this process \nwe are seeking the refutation of the hypothesis we are entertaining, \nas K. R.

    "content_html": "<p>The Structure of Tacit-Knowing by Michael Polanyi (As delivered on February 11, 1964 at Duke University) In my previous lecture I distinguished between ti~;.:em&gt;licit \u00b7\u00b7~\u00b7 ~f ;J content of a theory and its anticipatory powers. I ,.&quot;&#x27;.; f, I ascri~&#x27;d this surplus of meaning to the image of the theory. For modern physics this is embodied in the beauty of its mathematical form. I said \\ that the harmonies of such an image and of such mathematical formu- lations establish a presumption, that the theory has a bearing on reality and that by virtue of this bearing, it might anticipate future discoveries. I spoke of the heuristic powers of the mind, which enable us to discover such harnioijies, by grasping the coher- ., ence of clues which point to it; of clues which eventually may later be seen to form part of new discoveries. One could describe this process as the structuring of reality. My present lecture will analyse the structuring of reality. It is effortlessly done by our eyes and ears every time we see or listen to something, Dut its exercise may als.o be most arduous and indeed amount to scientific achievements like those of Copernicus. The effortless feat of our eyes and ears is an act of perception, while the discoveries of Copernicus were the work of the specula- tive imagination. Doth have it in common that they are not ex- plicit processes: not carried out on paper. They are informal, tacit operations. We shall see that, beside perception and the imagination, the forming of conceptions can also invqlve a tacit integration of clues amounting to a structuring of reality. We may include among the structuring powers also the developing and exer- cise of a sl&lt;ill. All practical l&lt;nowledge relies ultimately on skil-</p>\n<p>.,.. \u00b7&#x27;&#x27; 2 ful operations and in science we find everywhere observation com- bined with skilful testing. It will also simplify my argument, if it be understood that when I speak of comprehension, I.shall include, beside the comprehensive seeing of things, the sk\u2022ilful co-ordination of our muscles. ti cal comprehension are always combined within our own b6&#x27;.dy. For an experimental knowledge of the tacit operations estab- lishing coherence in nature, we must rely on the study of percep- tion by Gestalt psychology. It has more recently been expanded further by transactional psychology. These studies have revealed the complex procedure involved in seeing a simple solid object in front of us. Suppose I look at my.rig~t hand. I recognise its area by its closed contours. Dut if that were all, my hand., when moved about, would keep changing its colour, it~ shape and its &#x27; size. The experience of my hand as a solid object, having definite properties, would never arise. I see it as such, by integration of a host of rapidly changing clues, both in the field of vision and inside my eyes and some still deeper in my body. My powers of recognising coherence makes me see these thousand changing clues jointly, as one single unchanging object moving about at different distances, viewed from different -angles, under variabie illumina- tions. A successful integration of thousand variable particulars into a single constant sight, makes us recognise that we have a real object before us. We can get an important hint of the way this integration takes place, by looking at an object, for example, a finger of our own, through a pinhole in a sheet of paper. If I do this and then move my finger back and forth, I see it swelling as it approaches my eye.</p>\n<p>3 Psychologists have called this ef&#x27;fect a &quot;de-realisation&quot;. The moving object has lost in it some of&#x27; its invariance, for it lacks confirmation by the elements that normally contributed to its image f&#x27;rom the periphery of the visual f&#x27;ield and from the -o,tl:)J:lr .eye. The \u00b7 :~_,-. \u00b7t~t r:\u00b7 coherence established by our perception has been impove~h,id and -\u00b7, &#x27;&#x27;:&#x27; with it the object has lost some of its apparent reality., Reflecting on these examples of seeing an object, we learn two &#x27; things. First, that our tacit powers can integrate a much larger number of&#x27; variables at a far greater speed than any explicit pro- cedure, registering each of these variables in turn, could possibly carry out. The importance of&#x27; this for the pursuit of scientific discovery seems obvious, but I shall pass by it now. The second thing we learn is the fact that most of the clues we integrate so successfully to seeing an object are not known to us in themselves. Many of them cannot be sensed at all. The contractions of our eye &quot;\u00b7 muscles, for example, can never be experienced as such, we are aware of them only in the way they make us see the object that we are perceiving. Other clues, like those we cut out by a pin hole, we do sense, but only f&#x27;:l:&gt;om the corner of our eye. We do not attend to these either, but rely on our awareness of them for attending to the coherent entity to which they contribute. We can recognise here t1\u00b710 kinds of awareness that will prove fundamental to the tacit apprehension of coherence. Gestalt psy- .,,. chology has always insisted that when we comprehend a whole, we see its parts differently than we would see them in isolation;. that seen as parts they have a functional appearance, which they lack in isolation. We may generalise this by saying that the tacit know- ing of a coherent entity begins, when 1&#x27;/e convert bits of experience-</p>\n<p>4 which may be either subliminal or sensible--into clues to this coherent entity. This process includes the co-ordination of mus- cular actions which will both serve and shape our apprehension of the entity. The understanding of its coherence is CO\\f!p1eted, when \u00b7: . &lt;!&quot;&#x27; .::, .... :, . _.. ~.::-: ; . , the cl&#x27;iies and the worl&lt;ing of our muscles are embodied in1JI1r:\u00b7 appear- ,-.. \u2022,;-... &#x27;,- ance of the entity to apprehension of which they were directed. Such is the functional structure of tacit knowing. Let me emphasize the phenomenal changes marking this functional integration. He have noticed it when I described the seeing of my hand as an invariant real object integrated from thousands of swift- ly changing clues. The way I come to see my hand, the distance at which I see it, the shape I see it having, &#x27;its colour and texture, &#x27;\u00b7,. the speed and direction of its motion, all its sensory qualities, are determined by clues--whether mantfest\u00b7or deeply hidden and sub- liminal--which are integrated into its appearance. /111 these clues &quot; _ are now seen in the qualities of the ob,ject to which they have been integrated. I shall call this transformation of qualities, the phenomenal aspect of tacit knowing. Dut is it a fact t&quot;hat tacit l&lt;n01\u00b71ing altogether surpasses ex- plicit operations in achieving perception? Let us see. Take one element of visual perception: our capacity for seeing things stereoscopically, as objects distributed in depth, each surrounded ,, by empty space. The way we usually do this is a little complicated, but we can simplify our enquiry by starting with a stereoscopic photograph. A careful scrutiny of its two pictures will :&#x27;!how, that each object is depicted in them by a pair of slightly different images, taken from slightly different angles. The difference will be smaller for some objects, showing that they are further away.</p>\n<p>5 Some machine could conceivably worl, out l:&gt;oth the position of each object in space and the round shape of the several objects. They might supply us, for example, with the spacial coordinates of all the surfaces of the objects; or with a set of cross,;;&gt;_~_tions of the .. --.. , . \u00b7;\u2022~\u00b7l . , scene\u00b7, spaced inch by inch. Dut I can hardly think of a_ny, ,.purpose &#x27; ,};ij~i~- this tremendously complicated information would serve, ahd it cer- tainly could not replace the knowledge 11e can obtain at one glance by looking&#x27;simultaneously at one image with each eye. I have compared before a list giving the geographical position of all the towns in England, with a map of England showing these towns as disposed over the surface of the country. A computer could no doubt be devised to derive any particular itinerary from a list of positions, but the map would&quot;still be far more useful in guiding our imagination to ask new questions ahd form new projects by looking at the map. -- The unrivalled interpretative powers of tacit comprehension lie in the appearance of the coherence.which they establish. This may be a sensory appearance, as in visual perception, or an imagina- tive appearance, as in the map of a country. Our understanding of perceived experience lies in the :c,ensory qualities which indicate the coherence of a multitude of \u00b7sensory clues and convey their meaning to us. Since no explicit operation can produce such trans- formation of qualities, it would seem that in this case tacit in~ tegration is superior not only in practice, but in principle,\u00b7to any conceivable explicit integration of the information contained in an aggregate of sensory clues. Seeing is not guided by these clues as noted in themselves, but by the quality of their joint appearance.</p>\n<p>6 Experiences with inverting spectacles supply even more telling evidence to show that an explicit solution of a perceptual problem is ineffectual and indeed pointless. If you put on spectacles which make you see things the wrong way round--for examplE?Inve-;i;,ted be- .,\u00b7 . . ... . !.;f \u00b7\u00b7 ; ._&#x27; tirnen left and right--you feel completely lost. You ar~.itJh&#x27;~ble to use your hands or to walk about the room. Yet you have a perfect solution to.your problem in explicit terms. What you see on your \u2022 .. right is really on your left and vice versa. This is all you have to know, but this knowledge is useless. It takes too long to apply it and.hence you continue to react to what you falsely see, rather than to what you would know, if you followed the prescription for transposing the things you see into their correct location. On the -~ . \u00b7 other hand, what explicit instruction fails to convey, is achieved by the tacit action of our senses. If y~u persist in your effort to find your way, white wearing inverting spectacles, you will eventually see things rightly again. -\u00b7. Stratton who first discovered this fact in 1896 could find his way about by inverting spectacles after wearing them for 8 days. Other observers confirmed Stratton 1s exper1ence. The result of such training is so striking that it was long believed to consist in the reversal of the visual image to right way round. Dut this is not so. The experiments of Snyder and Pronko (1952) and of Ivq. Kohler and his pupils in Innsbruck have shown that this interpreta- tion was 1\u00b71rong. The sight of things is reversed only in the sense that they are once more seen right, that is, seen in such a way that the subject can find his way about by following what he sees. He finds his way, because the new way of seeing things once more \u00b7 coordinates his vision with the feelings of his muscular action. In</p>\n<p>7 a sense, things visually observed the wrong 11ay round are felt then to be the right way round; a subject wearing right-left inverting glasses will say that &quot;depending on whether I attend more to my hand or to the rest of the visual field, I would asc&#x27;&#x27;r&#x27;iee-... :l;o it the . .\u00b7;,,\u00b7&#x27; \u00b5~ i--\u00b7 .: quality of rightness or leftness.&quot; Actually, visual anl:\\~~Yoprio- ceptive qualities are fused to a novel mode of perception, in terms of which the subject achieves a correct understanding of the in- \\. verted sights. Summing up the results of the Innsbruck School, Kottenhoff, a pupil of Ivo Kohler writes (1961) that at this stage of the experiment &quot;the question 1\u00b71hether something is to the right or to the left was felt to be rather annoying.&quot; Snyder and Pronko observed the same tendency in the\u00b7 following way. The subject, wear- ing upside-down inverting spectacles, &quot;was observing the scene from a tall building. Suddenly someone asked, &#x27;Helt, how; do things look to you? Are they upside dotm? 1 &#x27;- The subject replied, &#x27;I wish you hadn 1t asked me. Now, when I recall hoi&#x27;/ they did look before I put on these lenses, I must answer that they look upside down~- Dut until the moment that you asked me I was absolutely unaware of it \u2022 and hadn&#x27;t given a thought to the question whether things were right- side-up or upside -down. &#x27; 11 Thus it appears that 1) an explicit prescription for interpreting experience is of \u2022 . &quot; little use for finding one&#x27;s way by inverted vision; 2) an effective understanding of the situation is achieved tacitly by acquiring a novel 1-ray of seeing things. Clues of vision and motion are fused thereby into a new sensory quality, which presents a correct conception of the situation; 3) attempts at describing this quality in words denoting the</p>\n<p>8 normal qualities of sight and motion have misled earlier writers and half a century passed before they discovered what they ~rnre actually seeing. The reason i&#x27;or this blindness was that the novel sensory qualities of right seeing through inverting \u00b7ii3eet~ples can . .. t,.;,::-~: : &#x27;, be described only by terms lthich in ordinary parlance wdulcf:&#x27;be self . .&#x27; \u00b71: .. . . \u00b7~ . contradictory, In my last lecture I criticised the view that science is and \\ ought to be &#x27;an explicit functional relation between observed data and showed that the appearance of a theory in which lies its in- tellectual beauty, conveys a surplus meaning which, by bearing on reality, possesses anticipatory powers. We can see now that right perception has a distinctive sensory\u00b7quality which bears on reality \u2022 . &#x27;\u00b7\u00bd\u00b7 Weelsee that it thereby keeps the joint meaning of perceptual clues in evidence, and that this quality and this meaning c,an be lost if an attempt is made to spell out the relation of these clues in terms &quot;- of&#x27; an explicit functional relation. These i&#x27;acts strongly confirm my contention that only tacit knowing can solve a perceptual problem. It also indicates that such a solution t&#x27;lill constitute a conceptual innovation. Indeed, i&#x27;rom the fact that questions put in a language using the normal conceptions of &#x27;above&#x27; and &#x27;below&#x27; or &#x27;right&#x27; and 1left 1 cause confusion in the minds of subjects who have learned the right &lt;&#x27; way of seeing with inverted spectacles, we can conclude that the new kind of seeing is accompanied by a corresponding conceptual change, which extinguishes the usual meaning of the words &quot;above&quot;\u00b7and &quot;be- low&quot; and &quot;right&quot; and &quot;left&quot;. Since, as I hope to show in my next lecture, the formation of concepts is a prominent function of tacit knowing, a conceptual reform accompanying perceptual innovations,</p>\n<p>9 must also be predominantly tacit. Dy passing from perceptual to conceptual change, I can return to the subject of scientific discovery, and the nearest example to which I can turn I shall find in the discovery of relativity. The process in which relativity originated, was in fact ai~i;,g~us to .\u00b7.;, ~~&#x27; :.~ the wa~ one learns to see rightly with inverting spectac\\iekf/ Ein- stein has told the story, that from the age of sixteen he&#x27;was ob- sessed by a speculation which eventually led to his discovery. It had long been known that experiments with falling bodies give the same result on board of a ship in motion as it does on solid ground. Dut Einstein, as a boy, asked about the light which a lamp would emit on board a moving ship. Supposing the ship moves fast enough, &#x27; . will it overtake the beams of its own light, as an aeroplane over- . \u00b7,~ takes its own sound when reaching the supersonic barrier? Einstein thought that this was inconceivable, and he re-formed the concep- tions of space and tim!t in a way which would make it impossible for the ship to be said to overtake, however slightly, its own light\u00b7 \u2022&#x27;&quot; rays. The result was, that questions about a definite span of time or space became meaningless and confusing--just as questions of right and left became meaningless and confusing for a subject wear- ing inverting spectacles, who had righted his vision. I have been told that in the psychological laboratory at Innsbruck they substi- tute for the German designation of right and left, the English words\u00b7 &quot;right&quot; and &quot;left&quot; to designate the new kind of alternatives seen by re-verted vision, This is exactly as in relativistic language, the words &quot;length&quot; and &quot;duration&quot; are revised by linking them al- ways to a particular observer. Such conceptual changes are pri- marily tacit, even though they may be supported, as in the case of</p>\n<p>10 relativity, by formal expressions corresponding to them. I thin!( it j_s no accident that it is the most comprehensive innovation in the history of science that appears most similar to the way we acquire the capacity for seeing things rightly. For only such a,.comprehensive problem, as that of reorganisation of such basic conceptions \u00b7t.\\l&quot;~~=;.; \u00b7::,~:, relativity, can :require a . . &#x27; . ~- _ .!, 1t, (&#x27;. as we undertake\u00b7\u00b7 \u00b71n learning to see rightly through inverting spectacles. This righting of our vision invol:ves also a conceptual innovation as sweeping and as &quot;,, paradoxical as that achieved by Einstein in formulating relativity. I have shovm that in the process of perception, in the forming of new conceptions and in the exercise of the imagination, we can establish a valid coherence of particulars which lends their joint appearance a ~ew convincing quality. The way tacit knowing achieves this result will become much clearer if we now turn our attention to the fact that by tacit integration we can get to know consider- ably more than we can tell. I have implied this fact already in pointing out that we do not know in themselves the perceptual clues by which we discern an object. We could analyse in this sense the conceptual reforms in- volved in learning to see through inverting spectacles and also the discovery of relativity. Dut I 1\u00b71~nt \u00b7 to bring in some new material in which this feature of tacit knowing is more clearly identifiable. The classical case of knowing more than you can tell is met 1rr\u00b7 the knowing of a skill. I know how to ride a bicycle or how to swim, but this does not mean that I can tell by what principle I keep my balance on a bicycle or keep afloat when swimming. I may not have the slightest idea of this or even an entirely wrong idea of it, and yet go on cycling or swimming merrily, And suppose I</p>\n<p>.. 11 cannot ride a bicycle, it would not help me if I were told that in order to compensate for a given angle of imbalance (X, .I must tal{e a curve on the side of the imbalance, of which the radius r should be proportionate to the square o~ the velocity v over the imbalance Such knowledge, though true, is is possessed tacitly. \u00b7t \\l&#x27; ~ .. ~ ineffe.ctiw! ;.unless it ,\u00b7f;i-l t !&#x27;. .. We know a person&#x27;s face and can recognise him among a thousand, indeed among a million. Yet we usually cannot tell how we recognise \u00b7, a face we know. There are many other instances of the recognition of a characteristic appearance--some commonplace, others more tech- nical---which have the same structure as the idantification of a person. At the universities great efforts are spent in practical classes to teach students to identify cases of diseases and speci- mens of rocks, plants and animals. All descriptive sciences study such physiognomies which cannot be fully described in words, nor even by pictures. Al\u00a3\u00b7this practical teaching must rely on the in- telligent pupil 1s capacity to recog~ise the relevant particulars of .- a physiognomy and their characteristic relationship in the physiog- nomy. Dut can it not be argued that the possibility of teaching sl{ills and the recognition of character~stic appearances, proves that we can tell our knowledge of them? No, what the pupil must discover for himself by trial and error is--even though he be guided by our&quot; advice and example--something we could not tell him. This will become clearer from some fairly recent work in psy- chology. This has developed a method for stud;&#x27;,&#x27;ing the elementary act on which all tacit knowing is based. The wider public has heard of these experiments as exposing the machinery of h~dden persuasion</p>\n<p>12 More important seems the fact that they isolate for experimental investigation the faculty by which we apprehend the relation be- tl&#x27;1een two events, both of which we know, but only one of which we can tell. ~ollowing the example set chologists call the exercise of \u00b7til~\u00b7-... ; by Lazarus and McClea~-\u00b7-1~1949, psy- - . Jiu: ,t:&#x27; this faculty a process ot-,-:&#x27;&#x27;subcep- tion&quot;. These authors presented a person with a large number of nonsense syllables, and after showing certain of_the syllables, they ~ . administered an electric shock to the subject, Presently the per- son showed symptoms of anticipating the shock at the sight of &quot;shock syllables&quot;; yet, on questioning, he could not identify them. He had come to know when to expect_a shock, but he could not tell what made him_ expect it. He had acquired a l&lt;nowledge similar to that which we have when \\&#x27;le know a person by signs which we cannot tell. Another variant of- this phenomenon was demonstrated by Erickson and Kuethe in 1956, They exposed a person to shock whenever he ,- . happened to utter associations to certain &#x27;shock words&#x27;. Presently, the person learned to :t;:orestall the shock by avoiding the utterance of such associations, but, on questioning, it appeared that he did not kno,\u00b71 he was doing this. Here_ the subject invented a practical ope_ration, but could not tell how he worked it. This kind of sub- ception has the structure of a skill, for a skill combines elemen--,.. tary muscular acts which are not identifiable, according to rela- tions that we cannot define. These experiments show more clearly than the recognition of physiognomies can do, that we can know more than we can tell. For the procedure wards off the suspicion of self-contradiction, t-1hich</p>\n<p>13 arises when any0ne speaks of things he knows and cannot tell. It is avoided by the division of roles bet11een the subject and the observer. The experimenter observes that another person has a certain knowledge that he cannot tell, and so no one speaks here of a knowledge that he himself has and cannot tell.\u00b7 ,)t:.;.:_,,, .. -:, .. t-.::-~ ; .&#x27; \\&#x27;!e&quot;\u00b7 can sum up so far as follows. In two experiment~,\\~!fBbcep- tion Has induced by electric shock. In the first series;\u00b7t,he sub- ject was shocked after being shown certain nonsense syllables, and . &#x27; he learnt to expect this to happen. In the second series he learnt to suppress the uttering of certain associations, which would evoke the shocl&lt;. In both cases the knowledge of the shock-producing particulars remained tacit. The subject could not identify the particulars, yet he relied on his awareness of them for anticipat- ing the electric shock. Such is the basic structure of tacit knovring. It alHays in- volves two things bound together by being kno1\u00b7m in two different ways. Ue may call them the- two terms of tacit knm\u00b7ring. In the subception experiments the shock-syllables and the shock-associa- tions formed the first term and the electric shoe!&lt; which followed them was the second term. After the subject had learnt to connect these t1\u00b71O terms, the sight of the shock syllables evoked the expec- tation of a shock and the utterance of shock associations was sup- pressed in order to avoid shocl&lt;. l&#x27;lhy did this connection remain tacit? It would seem that this was due to the fact that the subject was riveting his attention on the electric shocl&lt;. He i-1as relying on his av1areness of the shoe!&lt; producing particulars only in their bearing on the electric shock. He came to rely on his a11areness of these particulars for the pur- /</p>\n<p>14 pose of attending to the electric shock. I have spoken before of the functional way the clues to a com- prehensive entity are related to this entity, This relation is isolated here in its elementary form. i&#x27;/ithin a tacit kn01&#x27;1ledge combining two terms, we know the electric sho~k, for~~\u00a3it~Jme, second .. &#x27;., &#x27; J r- ; . : t&#x27; term, by attending to it, and hence we know it indentifia:BiY. \\&#x27;le .. know the shock-producing particulars only by relying on our aware- ness of them for attending to something else, namely the electric . &#x27;I,, shock, and hence our knowledge of them remains tacit. t!e come to \u00b7 know these particulars as clues to the shock wlthout becoming able to identify them as such. In the comprehensive entity formed by the two terms of tacit knoVTing, we know the first term onj.y by re- lying on our awareness of it for attend:l,,ng to the second, viewed as the center of the comprehensive entity. In his book on Freedom of the l&#x27;llll, ;~ustin Farrar has spoken of disattending from certain things for attending to others. I shall adopt a similar usage by saying that in an act of tacit know- ing we attend from something for attending to something else; namely, from the first term to the second term of the tacit relation, as -- -. the center of this relation. In many t1ays the first term of this relation will prove to be nearer _to us, the second further away from us. Using the language of anatomy, we may call the first term proximal, and the second term distal. It is the proximal term, ,\u00b7 then, of which 1\u00b71e have a knowledge that we may not be able tr tell. In cases when there are a number of proximal terms, the distal term may be the comprehensive entity having no concrete center, to which we are attending from its parts. In the case of a human physiognomy, we rely on our awareness of its features for attending</p>\n<p>15 to the characteristic appearance of a face. \\&#x27;le are attending from the features to the face, and thus may be unable to specify the features. \\:le are relying likewise on our awareness of a combina- tion of muscular acts for attending to the performance of a skill. \u00b7~ _\\t~::;-::, .. ~4 We are attending from these elementary movements to _the.:.:.-achievement &quot; . - , ... :\u00b7:::-- .-.,-u:,t- of their joint purpose, and hence are usually unable t\u00b7o\\specify these elementary acts or the principle by which we are combining them. In my first analysis of tacit knowing by the example of look- ing at my finger, I found the f~nctional coherence of its structure vividly reflected_ in the firm and constant appearance of the per- ceived object, This phenomenal aspect of coherence was manifested even more strikingly by the perceptual, innovation of learning to see rightly through inverting spectacles. The appearance.of the experimental setting--composed of the nonsense syllables and the electric shocks--unde.rgoes a more subtle change, when we learn to anticipate a shock, our expectation of it which at first had been vague and uncertain, becomes sharply fluctuating; it suddenly rises at certain moments and subsides between them. So we may say that,. even though we do not learn to recognise the shoe!, syllables as distinct from other syllables, we do become aware of a shock-syl- lable in terms of the apprehension it evokes in us. In other words,. we are aware of seeing these syllables in terms of that on which .~te are focussing our attention, which is the probability of an elec- tric shock. Thus also, in the case of a physiognomy, we are aware , of its features in terms of the physiognomy we are lool,ing at and in the exercise of a skill, we are aware of its several muscular moves in terms of the performance to which we are attending.</p>\n<p>16 We can see here how intangible qualities may appear as tokens of deep unspecifiable structures. Hovr we can read a character in a face or a posture and meet in a person&#x27;s presence all that we know of his past. This will be seen to supply the;J!!_echanism by \u2022 \u00b7. &lt;!&#x27;&quot;&#x27;\u2022::-.-.. , ... . , .......... , which we know another mind. \\&#x27;le see re-appearing here,al~o for a . &#x27;??;~.;. ~ ~- moment the original problem of our enquiry, We recogni&#x27;.se that the logical position of a theoretical image in science is that of a . \\ comprehensive entity to which we are attending from its particulars. This is how in such an image we are aware of a coherence that is a token of reality. There is a significance in the relation between the two terms of tacit knowing which combines its .functional and phenomenal as- pects. l/hen the sight of certain syi&#x27;&#x27;lables makes us expect an electric shock, we may say that they signify the approach of a shock. This is their meaning to us. Therefore, when shock syl- &#x27; lables arouse an apprehension in us, without our being able to identify the syllables l&#x27;lhich arouse it; we know these syllables only in terms of their meaning, It is their meaning to which our attention is directed; it is in terms of their meaning that they enter into the appearance of that to which we are attending from them. We could say, in this sense, that a characteristic physiognomy ,. is the meaning of its features; which is, in fact, what 1\u00b71e do say when a physiognomy expresses a particular mood. To identify a physiognomy would then amount to relying on our awarene.ss of its features for attending to their Joint meaning. This may sound far- fetched, because the meaning of the features is observed at the same spot where the features are situated, and hence it is difficult to</p>\n<p>17 separate mentally the features from their meaning. Yet, the fact remains that the two are distinct, since we may know a physiognomy without being able to specify its particulars. To see more clearly the separation of a meaning from that which . : ~J::;; ~ .. .-.~. has this meaning, we may watch the use of a probe to ei&#x27;xp3:6re a -!,it; t ;&#x27; ... ,, . -,. cavern, or the way a blind man feels his way by tapping a:round with a stick. Anyone using a probe for the first time will feel its impact agai~~t his fingers and palm. Dut as we learn to use a probe, or to use\u00b7 a stick for feeling our way, our awareness of its impact on our hand is transformed into a sense of its point touching the object we are exploring. Thus our interpretative effort transposes our meaningless feelings into meaningful ones, and places these at - some distance from the original feelings. We become aware of the feelings in our hand in terms of their meaning 1.ocated at the far end of the probe or stick, for it is to this end that we are attend- ing. This happens also when we learn to use a tool. We attend to the meaning of its impact on our hands ~n terms of its effects on the things to which we are applying it and thus make these effects increasingly meaningful, We may recognise in this the semantic powers of tacit knowing, .. The v1ay. the skilful use of a tool_ or probe makes us feel the meaning of their impact on our hand at the far end of these instru- ments, reflects a general tendency for meaning to be displaced away from us. This is in fact my justification for using the terms. &#x27;prox- imal&#x27; and 1distal 1 to describe the first and the second term of tacit knowing. Let me return, with this in mind, to the mechanism of visual perception. I have mentioned the well known fact that the way we</p>\n<p>18 see an object is mainly determined by our awareness of certain events inside our body, which we cannot feel in themselves. We are aware of these processes inside our body in terms of position, size, shape and motion of an object, to which we are attenq.\u00b5:i:g; \u2022. In other \u00b7:-\u00b7:.-;\u2022r~,~ \u00b7\u00b7., words,&quot; .. we are attending from these internal processes to,t&#x27;i1~i&#x27;quali- -- . -,f;~~i&quot; ties of things outside. These qualities are what those :i.riternal processes~ to us \u2022. The transposition of bodily experiences into . \\ the perception of things outside, may appear then as an instance of the transposition of meaning at a distance which we found present in all tacit knowing, a.&quot;ld, most strikingly, in the use of tools and probes . . \u00b7 - --- It may be thought that the feelings transposed in perception \u00b7, \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\\~ dif-fer from those transposed in the use of tools or .probes,. by being hardly noticeable before their transposition. An answer--or at least part of an answer--is to be found in experiments extending subception to subliminal stimuli. Hefferline and collaborators have observed (1959) that when spontaneous muscular twitches, unfelt by the subject--but observeable by a million-fold amplification of their action currents--t1ere followed by brief cessation of an un- pleasant noise, the subject responded by increasing the frequency of the twitches and thus silencing the noise for a longer time. Experiments carried out during the past decade in Soviet Russia have- shown this phenomenon in a different manner. (Razran 1961) When an internal stimulus, which the subject cannot notice in itself-- such as the inflating of a rubber ball in the intestinal qanal--is repeatedly followed by a reward or punishment, the internal stimulus will come to arouse an anticipation of these events. We have here a process similar to that which I have postulated for explaining</p>\n<p>19 that in the act of perception we become av1are of subliminal events inside our body in the way we see things outside, This view of perception as a transposition of feelings--like that observed in the use of.probes and in the proce9~~of subception-- \u00b7. :\u00b7 ::_-,--:r ~\u2022-~~ . , is borne out by the fact that the capacity tci see exter?jla,l{pbjects &lt; :~.,;~&quot;i..1.- &lt;, is acquired, like the use of probes and the feats of subception, by an effort of learning which can be. laborious. \u00b7 Modern\\philosophers, like Ryle, have argued that perception does not involve projection, since ~Te are not previously aware of the internal processes which we are supposed to have projected into the qualities of things perceived. Dut we now have established that -projection of this very kind is presen~ in various instances of tacit knm;ing. Moreover, the fact that&quot; we do not originally sense the-internal processes in themselves, now appears irrelevant. , I would venture, therefore, to extend the ocope of tacit &quot;- knowing to include the neural traces in the cortex of the nervous system. This would place events going on inside our brain on the same footing as the subliminal tv;itches operated by Hefferline 1s subjects. The re.lat ion of mind and bodJ&#x27; becomes then an instance of the relation between the two terms of tacit knowing. Such a hypothesis does not explain how perceived sights, or any other states of consciousness, arise in conjunction with neural processes. It I&#x27; merely applies the principle that wherever some process in our body gives rise to consciousness in us, our tacit knowing of the process will mal&lt;e sense of it in terms of an experience to which we are attending. &#x27; This conception of the way the body participates in the act of perception, can be generalised to include the bodily roots of all</p>\n<p>20 knowledge and thought. It throws light then on the peculiar knowl- edge we have of our body by living in it. Our body is the only collection of things which we !mow almost exclusively by relying on our awareness of them for i\\\\1tending to . \u2022\u2022 \u00b7\u00b7-&lt;&quot;!&#x27;&quot;&#x27; ~.---,:~ .. . ..... &quot;&#x27;., something else. Parts of our body serve as tools for \u00b7ob,s~ry1ng \u00b7&#x27;:&#x27;\u00a5.:;., \u00b7 objects outside us and for manipulating these for purposes\u00b7 of our own, Every time we make sense of the world we rely on our tacit knowledge of\\ impacts that the world makes on our body and of the response of our body to these impacts. Such is the exceptional position of our body in the universe. I have described how we learn to feel the end of a tool or a probe hitting things outside. lie may regard this as the transforma- tion of the tool or probe into a sentietit extension of our body, Dut our awareness of our body for attending to things outside it suggests a wider generalisation of the feeling we have of our body. ---- Hhenever we are using certain things for attending from them to other things (in the way we usually use our own body) these things change their appearance. They appear to us now in terms of the entities to which we are attending from them, in the same way as we feel our own body in terms of things outside to which we are attend- ing from our body, In this sense\u00b7we can say that when we make some things function as the proximal term of tacit knowing, we incorpo- rate these things in our body--or extend our body to include them. Let me show you at a glance the 1\u00b71orld-wide consequences of this conclusion. We maim a thing function as the proximal term of a comprehensive entity whenever we see it as part of a whole. vle have analysed many instances of this kind: the seeing of a solid body, the discovery of relativity, the identification of physiognomies,</p>\n<p>21 the practice of skills. We could apply our present conclusions to all these, but I want to throw a quick glance over wider fields. Diology studies the shapes of living things and the way they grow into these shapes from germ cells; it describes the ,qrga,ns of living .. . -:;,*.:.; .. ~-:-: ;&quot; __ , things and explains the way they function; it explores :t!)],,e. pnotor \u00b7\u00b7_.\u2022::-...- and sensory functions of animals and their intelligent performances. All these are comprehensive entities. Morphology, physiology, \\ animal psychology--they all deal with comprehensive entities. The only way to know them is to comprehend the coherence of their parts. The structure of tacit knowing requires that we make these parts function as proximal terms, in the way we make our body function for handling things outside. It requires that, in this sense, we \u00b7,. interiorise these things in order to attend from them to the com- prehensive entity which they form. We must dwell in them, and not observe them in themselves, if we are to be aware of their bearing on the entities to which they belong.\u00b7 Only thus can we understand the way these comprehensive entities rely on their parts for per- forming their functions. This adds another&#x27;important feature to the structure of tacit knowing. It tells us what it is a ~nowledge of. We may call this its ontolop;ical aspect. I look forward to showing you as I go on in these lectures that tacit knowing is in fact the sovereign in- strument for establishing the existence of comprehensive entities and understanding their structure. At the same time, looking baclc on the process of&#x27; scientific discovery, we can see it confirmed here that in tacit knowing we have found a means of establishing coherence that clearly bears on reality.</p>\n<p>22 Let us realise now the peculiar position at which we have ar- rived. \\&#x27;le have seen the way tacit knowing establishes coherence by the powers of perception, conceptualisation, speculative imagina- tion and skilful effort. Compare this way of getting to know things 1;;he acquisition of knowledge by of \u00b7:):~:~~-~ ..... ~ .. with a process explicit,inference. l &#x27; . _t /&#x27;\u2022 In both cases there are two terms involved. The two te&#x27;\u00a3~i&#x27;of ex- plicit reasoning are its premises and its conclusions, those of tacit knowing are its proximal and its distal terms. Explicit rea- &#x27;\u2022 soning subjects explicit premises to formal operations and thus reaches explicit conclusions. Tacit knowing leads from its proximal term to its distal term by relying on the first for attending to the second; it brings to bear the proximal on the distal, and es- , tablishes the_ latter as the meaning of ,,the former. This is not done by a formal operation but by a process of integration striving for . &#x27;..:. - understanding. Nor is its result a conclusion that can be detached from its logical antecBdents: when proximal things come to be un- derstood as particulars of an entity to which they contribute, ,~e remain aware of them in terms of this entity. Explicit inferenc~ is the ideal of critical reason, for it is open to indefinitely repeated re-examination, bit by bit. You can scrutinise each of the premises :).n turn, and likewise the several operations by which you derived your result from them. A return to the antecedents of an act of comprehension is much more difficult.~ and uncertain. It involves an analysis of tacitly known particulars, which--as ,\u00b71e have seen--may not be identifiable, and also the revis- ing of an act of integration, guided by undefinable harmonies. ,\\n explicit inference can therefore be refuted by bringing up new evidence against it, while a tacit interpretation of clues, may not</p>\n<p>23 be shaken by facts that conflict i\u00b7rith it. We may actually know a perception to be illusory, and yet find that our eyes continue to present it to us. Science has set us an ideal of critical exacti~e,pe, which would .\u00b7 ::.&#x27;&quot;&lt;:!&#x27;&quot;~\u2022-;,{\u2022 elimii;iate such hazards and this ideal may well seem to rep:r~sent ,\\R~f~ our intellectual duty. For the immense superiority of human intel- ligence over that of the animal is due entirely to our capacity for explicit thought. Jean Piaget confirms the ideal of explicit infer- .. ences in his Psycholologie de 1 1Intelligence and other writings, when he demonstrates the growth of intelligence in maturing children in terms of the replacement of senso-motoric knowing by formal operations of the mind, He calls this a development from irrever- sible n:ental acts to reversible modes of inference. So taken is the great master by this growing mechanical efficiency of the mind, . &#x27; that he fails to deal with the fact that the irreversible acts of the mind include all its creative functions. Most writers on scientific knowledge express a similar prefer- ence for explicit thought by refusing to deal with the tacit process of discovery, which th~y assign to psychology or sociology. Dut I cannot see how a theory of knowledge can ignore the main process by which new knowledge is obtained .. It is to perform Hamlet without the prince. For scientific opinion ai\u00b7mrds its highest prize to .\u2022 feats of originality, that a restriction to explicit processes would exclude from the study of scientific lmowledge. I cannot deal with this conflict here. It is but a symptom of the universal tension between a triumphant lucidj_t;y :ittacking theoretically defenceless intangible realities, All my wrl-t1np:n nx\u2022e but an attempt to resolve this fateful tension, and the issue still</p>\n<p>-. 24 remains in the balance. Dut we have some results to carry for1\u00b71ard that will bear on this problem. I shall survey them under five headings. 1) Functional structure of tacit knowing. We possess an ,\u00b7 \u2022 -~~~ .. ,-Q&lt;&quot; ~t:~{\u2022 &#x27; , experimentally verifiable capacity for attending from Ol&quot;\\e,, thing to &#x27; . -- ,::~,J~..;..t~ another. The proximal term in this relation might be knoi1n only tacitly, that is, by relying on our awareness of it for attending to the distal term; or else to an entity comprehending both terms. A proximal term may be subliminal; in any case, not identifiable. - This is how we can know more than we can tell. 2) Semantic and phenomenal aspects. Tacit knowing lends a meaning to the proximal term of t1hich .we are aware in the appearance . . . \u00b7,_ of that which it means, be this the distal term or the comprehensive entity formed or recognised by the act of tacit knowing. There are important instances when a large number of particulars function proximally as clues to their joint meaning. This coherent whole is then their distal term; its harmonious appearance is token of its reality. We have seen perceptual innovations, conceptual reforms and scientific discoveries made by such a process. This seems to be the general structure of creative mental acts. 3) Indwelling. As we live in our body, we !{now it principally by attending fr0m it to things outside. Hence we may be said to .,,. use proximal terms 1\u00b71hen attending a~1ay from them, as we use our body; and hence also the meaning of proximals tends to be displaced away from us. To understand a complex entity, like a living being, is to interiorise its particulars with a bearing on the comprehensive functions of the living being. I{) Intuition. Since the coherence which equals a discovery is</p>\n<p>\u2022\u2022 25 achieved by a tacit integration, many of the clues on our awareness on which we rely for making that discovery may not be identifiable. Tacit knowing will tend to reach conclusions in ignorance of the steps employed. This is the process commonly known aa.intuition. , \u00b7~ )\u00b7~.~.,; ~\u00b7~~4 :, We can see now that this faculty is experimentally deinoristrable. It . ,};~.~ t: is not particularly mysterious and certainly not infallible. The traditional association of intuition with infallibility is profound- ly misleadi&#x27;ng. 5) Personal knowledge. The personal acts by which alone tacit knowledge can be acquired can all be derived from the way tacit knowledge is established by indwelling. Therefore, since all our knowledge, being rooted in our body, ~epends on the contributions of tacit coefficients, 1\u00b71e shall have t6 abandon the conception of strict scientific detachment and seek to. establ_ish instead a truer . &#x27; ideal of knowledge, which would accept indwelling as the univer\u00b7sal principle of knowing.</p>",
    "content_text": "The Structure of Tacit-Knowing \nby Michael Polanyi \n(As delivered on February 11, 1964 at Duke University) \nIn my previous lecture I distinguished between ti~;.:em>licit \n\u00b7\u00b7~\u00b7 \n~f ;J \ncontent of a theory and its anticipatory powers. \nI ,.\"'.; f, \nI ascri~'d this \nsurplus of meaning to the image of the theory. \nFor modern physics \nthis is embodied in the beauty of its mathematical form. \nI said \n\\ \nthat the harmonies of such an image and of such mathematical formu-\nlations establish a presumption, that the theory has a bearing on \nreality and that by virtue of this bearing, it might anticipate \nfuture discoveries. \nI spoke of the heuristic powers of the mind, \nwhich enable us to discover such harnioijies, by grasping the coher-\n., \nence of clues which point to it; of clues which eventually may later \nbe seen to form part of new discoveries. \nOne could describe this \nprocess as the structuring of reality. \nMy present lecture will analyse the structuring of reality. \nIt is effortlessly done by our eyes and ears every time we see or \nlisten to something, \nDut its exercise may als.o be most arduous and \nindeed amount to scientific achievements like those of Copernicus. \nThe effortless feat of our eyes and ears is an act of perception, \nwhile the discoveries of Copernicus were the work of the specula-\ntive imagination. \nDoth have it in common that they are not ex-\nplicit processes: \nnot carried out on paper. \nThey are informal, \ntacit operations. \nWe shall see that, beside perception and the \nimagination, the forming of conceptions can also invqlve a tacit \nintegration of clues amounting to a structuring of reality. \nWe may \ninclude among the structuring powers also the developing and exer-\ncise of a sl<ill. \nAll practical l<nowledge relies ultimately on skil-\n\n.,.. \n\u00b7'' \n2 \nful operations and in science we find everywhere observation com-\nbined with skilful testing. It will also simplify my argument, if \nit be understood that when I speak of comprehension, I.shall include, \nbeside the comprehensive seeing of things, \nthe sk\u2022ilful co-ordination of our muscles. \nti cal comprehension are always combined within our own b6'.dy. \nFor an experimental knowledge of the tacit operations estab-\nlishing coherence in nature, we must rely on the study of percep-\ntion by Gestalt psychology. It has more recently been expanded \nfurther by transactional psychology. \nThese studies have revealed \nthe complex procedure involved in seeing a simple solid object in \nfront of us. \nSuppose I look at my.rig~t hand. \nI recognise its \narea by its closed contours. \nDut if that were all, my hand., when \nmoved about, would keep changing its colour, it~ shape and its \n' \nsize. \nThe experience of my hand as a solid object, having definite \nproperties, would never arise. \nI see it as such, by integration of \na host of rapidly changing clues, both in the field of vision and \ninside my eyes and some still deeper in my body. \nMy powers of \nrecognising coherence makes me see these thousand changing clues \njointly, as one single unchanging object moving about at different \ndistances, viewed from different -angles, under variabie illumina-\ntions. \nA successful integration of thousand variable particulars \ninto a single constant sight, makes us recognise that we have a \nreal object before us. \nWe can get an important hint of the way this integration takes \nplace, by looking at an object, for example, a finger of our own, \nthrough a pinhole in a sheet of paper. If I do this and then move \nmy finger back and forth, I see it swelling as it approaches my eye. \n\n3 \nPsychologists have called this ef'fect a \"de-realisation\". \nThe \nmoving object has lost in it some of' its invariance, for it lacks \nconfirmation by the elements that normally contributed to its image \nf'rom the periphery of the visual f'ield and from the -o,tl:)J:lr .eye. \nThe \n\u00b7 :~_,-. \u00b7t~t r:\u00b7 \ncoherence established by our perception has been impove~h,id and \n-\u00b7, '':' \nwith it the object has lost some of its apparent reality., \nReflecting on these examples of seeing an object, we learn two \n' \nthings. First, that our tacit powers can integrate a much larger \nnumber of' variables at a far greater speed than any explicit pro-\ncedure, registering each of these variables in turn, could possibly \ncarry out. \nThe importance of' this for the pursuit of scientific \ndiscovery seems obvious, but I shall pass by it now. \nThe second \nthing we learn is the fact that most of the clues we integrate so \nsuccessfully to seeing an object are not known to us in themselves. \nMany of them cannot be sensed at all. \nThe contractions of our eye \n\"\u00b7 \nmuscles, for example, can never be experienced as such, we are \naware of them only in the way they make us see the object that we \nare perceiving. \nOther clues, like those we cut out by a pin hole, \nwe do sense, but only f':l:>om the corner of our eye. \nWe do not attend \nto these either, but rely on our awareness of them for attending \nto the coherent entity to which they contribute. \nWe can recognise here t1\u00b710 kinds of awareness that will prove \nfundamental to the tacit apprehension of coherence. \nGestalt psy-\n.,,. \nchology has always insisted that when we comprehend a whole, we see \nits parts differently than we would see them in isolation;. that \nseen as parts they have a functional appearance, which they lack \nin isolation. \nWe may generalise this by saying that the tacit know-\ning of a coherent entity begins, when 1'/e convert bits of experience-\n\n4 \nwhich may be either subliminal or sensible--into clues to this \ncoherent entity. \nThis process includes the co-ordination of mus-\ncular actions which will both serve and shape our apprehension of \nthe entity. \nThe understanding of its coherence is CO\\f!p1eted, when \n\u00b7: \n. \n<!\"' .::, .... :, \n. _.. \n~.::-: ; . , \nthe cl'iies and the worl<ing of our muscles are embodied in1JI1r:\u00b7 appear-\n,-.. \u2022,;-... ',-\nance of the entity to apprehension of which they were directed. \nSuch is the functional structure of tacit knowing. \nLet me emphasize the phenomenal changes marking this functional \nintegration. \nHe have noticed it when I described the seeing of my \nhand as an invariant real object integrated from thousands of swift-\nly changing clues. \nThe way I come to see my hand, the distance at \nwhich I see it, the shape I see it having, 'its colour and texture, \n'\u00b7,. \nthe speed and direction of its motion, all its sensory qualities, \nare determined by clues--whether mantfest\u00b7or deeply hidden and sub-\nliminal--which are integrated into its appearance. \n/111 these clues \n\" \n_ are now seen in the qualities of the ob,ject to which they have been \nintegrated. \nI shall call this transformation of qualities, the \nphenomenal aspect of tacit knowing. \nDut is it a fact t\"hat tacit l<n01\u00b71ing altogether surpasses ex-\nplicit operations in achieving perception? Let us see. \nTake one \nelement of visual perception: \nour capacity for seeing things \nstereoscopically, as objects distributed in depth, each surrounded ,, \nby empty space. \nThe way we usually do this is a little complicated, \nbut we can simplify our enquiry by starting with a stereoscopic \nphotograph. \nA careful scrutiny of its two pictures will :'!how, that \neach object is depicted in them by a pair of slightly different \nimages, taken from slightly different angles. \nThe difference will \nbe smaller for some objects, showing that they are further away. \n\n5 \nSome machine could conceivably worl, out l:>oth the position of each \nobject in space and the round shape of the several objects. \nThey \nmight supply us, for example, with the spacial coordinates of all \nthe surfaces of the objects; or with a set of cross,;;>_~_tions of the \n.. --.. , . \u00b7;\u2022~\u00b7l . , \nscene\u00b7, spaced inch by inch. \nDut I can hardly think of a_ny, ,.purpose \n' \n,};ij~i~-\nthis tremendously complicated information would serve, ahd it cer-\ntainly could not replace the knowledge 11e can obtain at one glance \nby looking'simultaneously at one image with each eye. \nI have compared before a list giving the geographical position \nof all the towns in England, with a map of England showing these \ntowns as disposed over the surface of the country. \nA computer \ncould no doubt be devised to derive any particular itinerary from \na list of positions, but the map would\"still be far more useful in \nguiding our imagination to ask new questions ahd form new projects \nby looking at the map. \n--\nThe unrivalled interpretative powers of tacit comprehension \nlie in the appearance of the coherence.which they establish. This \nmay be a sensory appearance, as in visual perception, or an imagina-\ntive appearance, as in the map of a country. \nOur understanding of \nperceived experience lies in the :c,ensory qualities which indicate \nthe coherence of a multitude of \u00b7sensory clues and convey their \nmeaning to us. \nSince no explicit operation can produce such trans-\nformation of qualities, it would seem that in this case tacit in~ \ntegration is superior not only in practice, but in principle,\u00b7to \nany conceivable explicit integration of the information contained \nin an aggregate of sensory clues. \nSeeing is not guided by these \nclues as noted in themselves, but by the quality of their joint \nappearance. \n\n6 \nExperiences with inverting spectacles supply even more telling \nevidence to show that an explicit solution of a perceptual problem \nis ineffectual and indeed pointless. If you put on spectacles which \nmake you see things the wrong way round--for examplE?Inve-;i;,ted be-\n.,\u00b7 \n. \n. ... . !.;f \u00b7\u00b7 ; ._' \ntirnen left and right--you feel completely lost. \nYou ar~.itJh'~ble to \nuse your hands or to walk about the room. \nYet you have a perfect \nsolution to.your problem in explicit terms. \nWhat you see on your \n\u2022 .. \nright is really on your left and vice versa. \nThis is all you have \nto know, but this knowledge is useless. It takes too long to apply \nit and.hence you continue to react to what you falsely see, rather \nthan to what you would know, if you followed the prescription for \ntransposing the things you see into their correct location. \nOn the \n-~ \n. \n\u00b7 other hand, what explicit instruction fails to convey, is achieved \nby the tacit action of our senses. If y~u persist in your effort \nto find your way, white wearing inverting spectacles, you will \neventually see things rightly again. \n-\u00b7. \nStratton who first discovered this fact in 1896 could find his \nway about by inverting spectacles after wearing them for 8 days. \nOther observers confirmed Stratton 1s exper1ence. \nThe result of \nsuch training is so striking that it was long believed to consist \nin the reversal of the visual image to right way round. \nDut this \nis not so. \nThe experiments of Snyder and Pronko (1952) and of Ivq. \nKohler and his pupils in Innsbruck have shown that this interpreta-\ntion was 1\u00b71rong. \nThe sight of things is reversed only in the sense \nthat they are once more seen right, that is, seen in such a way \nthat the subject can find his way about by following what he sees. \nHe finds his way, because the new way of seeing things once more \n\u00b7 coordinates his vision with the feelings of his muscular action. In \n\n7 \na sense, things visually observed the wrong 11ay round are felt then \nto be the right way round; a subject wearing right-left inverting \nglasses will say that \"depending on whether I attend more to my \nhand or to the rest of the visual field, I would asc''r'iee-... :l;o it the \n. \n.\u00b7;,,\u00b7' \n\u00b5~ i--\u00b7 \n.: \nquality of rightness or leftness.\" Actually, visual anl:\\~~Yoprio-\nceptive qualities are fused to a novel mode of perception, in terms \nof which the subject achieves a correct understanding of the in-\n\\. \nverted sights. \nSumming up the results of the Innsbruck School, \nKottenhoff, a pupil of Ivo Kohler writes (1961) that at this stage \nof the experiment \"the question 1\u00b71hether something is to the right \nor to the left was felt to be rather annoying.\" \nSnyder and Pronko \nobserved the same tendency in the\u00b7 following way. \nThe subject, wear-\ning upside-down inverting spectacles, \"was observing the scene from \na tall building. \nSuddenly someone asked, 'Helt, how; do things look \nto you? \nAre they upside dotm? 1 \n'-\nThe subject replied, 'I wish you \nhadn 1t asked me. \nNow, when I recall hoi'/ they did look before I put \non these lenses, I must answer that they look upside down~-\nDut \nuntil the moment that you asked me I was absolutely unaware of it \n\u2022 \nand hadn't given a thought to the question whether things were right-\nside-up or upside -down. '\n11 \nThus it appears that \n1) an explicit prescription for interpreting experience is of \u2022 \n. \" \nlittle use for finding one's way by inverted vision; \n2) an effective understanding of the situation is achieved \ntacitly by acquiring a novel 1-ray of seeing things. \nClues of vision \nand motion are fused thereby into a new sensory quality, which \npresents a correct conception of the situation; \n3) attempts at describing this quality in words denoting the \n\n8 \nnormal qualities of sight and motion have misled earlier writers \nand half a century passed before they discovered what they ~rnre \nactually seeing. \nThe reason i'or this blindness was that the novel \nsensory qualities of right seeing through inverting \u00b7ii3eet~ples can \n. \n.. \nt,.;,::-~: : ', \nbe described only by terms lthich in ordinary parlance wdulcf:'be self \n. .' \u00b71: .. \n. . \u00b7~ . \ncontradictory, \nIn my last lecture I criticised the view that science is and \n\\ \nought to be 'an explicit functional relation between observed data \nand showed that the appearance of a theory in which lies its in-\ntellectual beauty, conveys a surplus meaning which, by bearing on \nreality, possesses anticipatory powers. \nWe can see now that right \nperception has a distinctive sensory\u00b7quality which bears on reality \u2022 \n. '\u00b7\u00bd\u00b7 \nWeelsee that it thereby keeps the joint meaning of perceptual clues \nin evidence, and that this quality and this meaning c,an be lost if \nan attempt is made to spell out the relation of these clues in terms \n\"-\nof' an explicit functional relation. \nThese i'acts strongly confirm \nmy contention that only tacit knowing can solve a perceptual problem. \nIt also indicates that such a solution t'lill constitute a conceptual \ninnovation. \nIndeed, i'rom the fact that questions put in a language using \nthe normal conceptions of 'above' and 'below' or 'right' and \n1left 1 \ncause confusion in the minds of subjects who have learned the right \n<' \nway of seeing with inverted spectacles, we can conclude that the new \nkind of seeing is accompanied by a corresponding conceptual change, \nwhich extinguishes the usual meaning of the words \"above\"\u00b7and \"be-\nlow\" and \"right\" and \"left\". \nSince, as I hope to show in my next \nlecture, the formation of concepts is a prominent function of tacit \nknowing, a conceptual reform accompanying perceptual innovations, \n\n9 \nmust also be predominantly tacit. \nDy passing from perceptual to conceptual change, I can return \nto the subject of scientific discovery, and the nearest example to \nwhich I can turn I shall find in the discovery of relativity. \nThe \nprocess in which relativity originated, was in fact ai~i;,g~us to \n.\u00b7.;, \n~~' :.~ \nthe wa~ one learns to see rightly with inverting spectac\\iekf/ Ein-\nstein has told the story, that from the age of sixteen he'was ob-\nsessed by a speculation which eventually led to his discovery. It \nhad long been known that experiments with falling bodies give the \nsame result on board of a ship in motion as it does on solid ground. \nDut Einstein, as a boy, asked about the light which a lamp would \nemit on board a moving ship. \nSupposing the ship moves fast enough, \n' . \nwill it overtake the beams of its own light, as an aeroplane over-\n. \u00b7,~ \ntakes its own sound when reaching the supersonic barrier? Einstein \nthought that this was inconceivable, and he re-formed the concep-\ntions of space and tim!t in a way which would make it impossible for \nthe ship to be said to overtake, however slightly, its own light\u00b7 \n\u2022'\" \nrays. \nThe result was, that questions about a definite span of time \nor space became meaningless and confusing--just as questions of \nright and left became meaningless and confusing for a subject wear-\ning inverting spectacles, who had righted his vision. \nI have been \ntold that in the psychological laboratory at Innsbruck they substi-\ntute for the German designation of right and left, the English words\u00b7 \n\"right\" and \"left\" to designate the new kind of alternatives seen \nby re-verted vision, \nThis is exactly as in relativistic language, \nthe words \"length\" and \"duration\" are revised by linking them al-\nways to a particular observer. \nSuch conceptual changes are pri-\nmarily tacit, even though they may be supported, as in the case of \n\n10 \nrelativity, by formal expressions corresponding to them. \nI thin!( it j_s no accident that it is the most comprehensive \ninnovation in the history of science that appears most similar to \nthe way we acquire the capacity for seeing things rightly. \nFor only \nsuch a,.comprehensive problem, as that of \nreorganisation of such basic conceptions \n\u00b7t.\\l\"~~=;.; \u00b7::,~:, \nrelativity, can :require a \n. . ' . ~-\n_ .!, 1t, ('. \nas we undertake\u00b7\u00b7 \u00b71n learning \nto see rightly through inverting spectacles. This righting of our \nvision invol:ves also a conceptual innovation as sweeping and as \n\",, \nparadoxical as that achieved by Einstein in formulating relativity. \nI have shovm that in the process of perception, in the forming \nof new conceptions and in the exercise of the imagination, we can \nestablish a valid coherence of particulars which lends their joint \nappearance a ~ew convincing quality. \nThe way tacit knowing achieves \nthis result will become much clearer if we now turn our attention \nto the fact that by tacit integration we can get to know consider-\nably more than we can tell. \nI have implied this fact already in pointing out that we do \nnot know in themselves the perceptual clues by which we discern an \nobject. \nWe could analyse in this sense the conceptual reforms in-\nvolved in learning to see through inverting spectacles and also the \ndiscovery of relativity. \nDut I 1\u00b71~nt \u00b7 to bring in some new material \nin which this feature of tacit knowing is more clearly identifiable. \nThe classical case of knowing more than you can tell is met 1rr\u00b7 \nthe knowing of a skill. \nI know how to ride a bicycle or how to \nswim, but this does not mean that I can tell by what principle I \nkeep my balance on a bicycle or keep afloat when swimming. \nI may \nnot have the slightest idea of this or even an entirely wrong idea \nof it, and yet go on cycling or swimming merrily, \nAnd suppose I \n\n.. \n11 \ncannot ride a bicycle, it would not help me if I were told that in \norder to compensate for a given angle of imbalance (X, .I must tal{e \na curve on the side of the imbalance, of which the radius r should \nbe proportionate to the square o~ the velocity v over the imbalance \nSuch knowledge, though true, is \nis possessed tacitly. \n\u00b7t \\l' ~ .. ~ \nineffe.ctiw! ;.unless it \n,\u00b7f;i-l t !'. \n.. \nWe know a person's face and can recognise him among a thousand, \nindeed among a million. \nYet we usually cannot tell how we recognise \n\u00b7, \na face we know. \nThere are many other instances of the recognition \nof a characteristic appearance--some commonplace, others more tech-\nnical---which have the same structure as the idantification of a \nperson. \nAt the universities great efforts are spent in practical \nclasses to teach students to identify cases of diseases and speci-\nmens of rocks, plants and animals. \nAll descriptive sciences study \nsuch physiognomies which cannot be fully described in words, nor \neven by pictures. \nAl\u00a3\u00b7this practical teaching must rely on the in-\ntelligent pupil 1s capacity to recog~ise the relevant particulars of \n.-\na physiognomy and their characteristic relationship in the physiog-\nnomy. \nDut can it not be argued that the possibility of teaching sl{ills \nand the recognition of character~stic appearances, proves that we \ncan tell our knowledge of them? \nNo, what the pupil must discover \nfor himself by trial and error is--even though he be guided by our\" \nadvice and example--something we could not tell him. \nThis will become clearer from some fairly recent work in psy-\nchology. \nThis has developed a method for stud;','ing the elementary \nact on which all tacit knowing is based. \nThe wider public has heard \nof these experiments as exposing the machinery of h~dden persuasion \n\n12 \nMore important seems the fact that they isolate for experimental \ninvestigation the faculty by which we apprehend the relation be-\ntl'1een two events, both of which we know, but only one of which we \ncan tell. \n~ollowing the example set \nchologists call the exercise of \n\u00b7til~\u00b7-... ; \nby Lazarus and McClea~-\u00b7-1~1949, psy-\n-\n. \nJiu: ,t:' \nthis faculty a process ot-,-:''subcep-\ntion\". \nThese authors presented a person with a large number of \nnonsense syllables, and after showing certain of_the syllables, they \n~ \n. \nadministered an electric shock to the subject, \nPresently the per-\nson showed symptoms of anticipating the shock at the sight of \n\"shock syllables\"; yet, on questioning, he could not identify them. \nHe had come to know when to expect_a shock, but he could not tell \nwhat made him_ expect it. \nHe had acquired a l<nowledge similar to \nthat which we have when \\'le know a person by signs which we cannot \ntell. \nAnother variant of- this phenomenon was demonstrated by Erickson \nand Kuethe in 1956, \nThey exposed a person to shock whenever he \n,- . \nhappened to utter associations to certain 'shock words'. \nPresently, \nthe person learned to :t;:orestall the shock by avoiding the utterance \nof such associations, but, on questioning, it appeared that he did \nnot kno,\u00b71 he was doing this. \nHere_ the subject invented a practical \nope_ration, but could not tell how he worked it. This kind of sub-\nception has the structure of a skill, for a skill combines elemen--,.. \ntary muscular acts which are not identifiable, according to rela-\ntions that we cannot define. \nThese experiments show more clearly than the recognition of \nphysiognomies can do, that we can know more than we can tell. For \nthe procedure wards off the suspicion of self-contradiction, t-1hich \n\n13 \narises when any0ne speaks of things he knows and cannot tell. It \nis avoided by the division of roles bet11een the subject and the \nobserver. \nThe experimenter observes that another person has a \ncertain knowledge that he cannot tell, and so no one speaks here \nof a knowledge that he himself has and cannot tell.\u00b7 ,)t:.;.:_,,, .. -:, \n.. \nt-.::-~ ; .' \n\\'!e\"\u00b7 can sum up so far as follows. \nIn two experiment~,\\~!fBbcep-\ntion Has induced by electric shock. \nIn the first series;\u00b7t,he sub-\nject was shocked after being shown certain nonsense syllables, and \n. \n' \nhe learnt to expect this to happen. \nIn the second series he learnt \nto suppress the uttering of certain associations, which would evoke \nthe shocl<. \nIn both cases the knowledge of the shock-producing \nparticulars remained tacit. \nThe subject could not identify the \nparticulars, yet he relied on his awareness of them for anticipat-\ning the electric shock. \nSuch is the basic structure of tacit knovring. \nIt alHays in-\nvolves two things bound together by being kno1\u00b7m in two different \nways. \nUe may call them the- two terms of tacit knm\u00b7ring. \nIn the \nsubception experiments the shock-syllables and the shock-associa-\ntions formed the first term and the electric shoe!< which followed \nthem was the second term. \nAfter the subject had learnt to connect \nthese t1\u00b71O terms, the sight of the shock syllables evoked the expec-\ntation of a shock and the utterance of shock associations was sup-\npressed in order to avoid shocl<. \nl'lhy did this connection remain tacit? It would seem that this \nwas due to the fact that the subject was riveting his attention on \nthe electric shocl<. \nHe i-1as relying on his av1areness of the shoe!< \nproducing particulars only in their bearing on the electric shock. \nHe came to rely on his a11areness of these particulars for the pur-\n/ \n\n14 \npose of attending to the electric shock. \nI have spoken before of the functional way the clues to a com-\nprehensive entity are related to this entity, \nThis relation is \nisolated here in its elementary form. \ni'/ithin a tacit kn01'1ledge \ncombining two terms, we know the electric sho~k, for~~\u00a3it~Jme, second \n.. \n'., \n' \nJ r-\n; . : t' \nterm, by attending to it, and hence we know it indentifia:BiY. \n\\'le \n.. \nknow the shock-producing particulars only by relying on our aware-\nness of them for attending to something else, namely the electric \n. \n'I,, \nshock, and hence our knowledge of them remains tacit. \nt!e come to \n\u00b7 know these particulars as clues to the shock wlthout becoming able \nto identify them as such. \nIn the comprehensive entity formed by \nthe two terms of tacit knoVTing, we know the first term onj.y by re-\nlying on our awareness of it for attend:l,,ng to the second, viewed \nas the center of the comprehensive entity. \nIn his book on Freedom of the l'llll, ;~ustin Farrar has spoken \nof disattending from certain things for attending to others. \nI \nshall adopt a similar usage by saying that in an act of tacit know-\ning we attend from something for attending to something else; namely, \nfrom the first term to the second term of the tacit relation, as \n--\n-. \nthe center of this relation. \nIn many t1ays the first term of this \nrelation will prove to be nearer _to us, the second further away from \nus. \nUsing the language of anatomy, we may call the first term \nproximal, and the second term distal. It is the proximal term, \n,\u00b7 \nthen, of which 1\u00b71e have a knowledge that we may not be able tr tell. \nIn cases when there are a number of proximal terms, the distal \nterm may be the comprehensive entity having no concrete center, to \nwhich we are attending from its parts. \nIn the case of a human \nphysiognomy, we rely on our awareness of its features for attending \n\n15 \nto the characteristic appearance of a face. \n\\'le are attending from \nthe features to the face, and thus may be unable to specify the \nfeatures. \n\\:le are relying likewise on our awareness of a combina-\ntion of muscular acts for attending to the performance of a skill. \n\u00b7~ _\\t~::;-::, .. ~4 \nWe are attending from these elementary movements to _the.:.:.-achievement \n\" \n. \n-\n, ... :\u00b7:::--\n.-.,-u:,t-\nof their joint purpose, and hence are usually unable t\u00b7o\\specify \nthese elementary acts or the principle by which we are combining \nthem. \nIn my first analysis of tacit knowing by the example of look-\ning at my finger, I found the f~nctional coherence of its structure \nvividly reflected_ in the firm and constant appearance of the per-\nceived object, \nThis phenomenal aspect of coherence was manifested \neven more strikingly by the perceptual, innovation of learning to \nsee rightly through inverting spectacles. \nThe appearance.of the \nexperimental setting--composed of the nonsense syllables and the \nelectric shocks--unde.rgoes a more subtle change, when we learn to \nanticipate a shock, our expectation of it which at first had been \nvague and uncertain, becomes sharply fluctuating; it suddenly rises \nat certain moments and subsides between them. \nSo we may say that,. \neven though we do not learn to recognise the shoe!, syllables as \ndistinct from other syllables, we do become aware of a shock-syl-\nlable in terms of the apprehension it evokes in us. \nIn other words,. \nwe are aware of seeing these syllables in terms of that on which .~te \nare focussing our attention, which is the probability of an elec-\ntric shock. \nThus also, in the case of a physiognomy, we are aware \n, \nof its features in terms of the physiognomy we are lool,ing at and \nin the exercise of a skill, we are aware of its several muscular \nmoves in terms of the performance to which we are attending. \n\n16 \nWe can see here how intangible qualities may appear as tokens \nof deep unspecifiable structures. \nHovr we can read a character in \na face or a posture and meet in a person's presence all that we \nknow of his past. \nThis will be seen to supply the;J!!_echanism by \n\u2022 \u00b7. \n<!'\"'\u2022::-.-.. \n, ... \n. , \n.......... , \nwhich we know another mind. \n\\'le see re-appearing here,al~o for a \n. \n'??;~.;. ~ ~-\nmoment the original problem of our enquiry, \nWe recogni'.se that the \nlogical position of a theoretical image in science is that of a \n. \n\\ \ncomprehensive entity to which we are attending from its particulars. \nThis is how in such an image we are aware of a coherence that is a \ntoken of reality. \nThere is a significance in the relation between the two terms \nof tacit knowing which combines its .functional and phenomenal as-\npects. \nl/hen the sight of certain syi''lables makes us expect an \nelectric shock, we may say that they signify the approach of a \nshock. \nThis is their meaning to us. \nTherefore, when shock syl-\n' \nlables arouse an apprehension in us, without our being able to \nidentify the syllables l'lhich arouse it; we know these syllables \nonly in terms of their meaning, \nIt is their meaning to which our \nattention is directed; it is in terms of their meaning that they \nenter into the appearance of that to which we are attending from \nthem. \nWe could say, in this sense, that a characteristic physiognomy \n,. \nis the meaning of its features; which is, in fact, what 1\u00b71e do say \nwhen a physiognomy expresses a particular mood. \nTo identify a \nphysiognomy would then amount to relying on our awarene.ss of its \nfeatures for attending to their Joint meaning. \nThis may sound far-\nfetched, because the meaning of the features is observed at the same \nspot where the features are situated, and hence it is difficult to \n\n17 \nseparate mentally the features from their meaning. \nYet, the fact \nremains that the two are distinct, since we may know a physiognomy \nwithout being able to specify its particulars. \nTo see more clearly the separation of a meaning from that which \n. : ~J::;; ~ .. .-.~. \nhas this meaning, we may watch the use of a probe to ei'xp3:6re a \n-!,it; t ;' \n... ,, . -,. \ncavern, or the way a blind man feels his way by tapping a:round with \na stick. \nAnyone using a probe for the first time will feel its \nimpact agai~~t his fingers and palm. \nDut as we learn to use a probe, \nor to use\u00b7 a stick for feeling our way, our awareness of its impact \non our hand is transformed into a sense of its point touching the \nobject we are exploring. \nThus our interpretative effort transposes \nour meaningless feelings into meaningful ones, and places these at \n-\nsome distance from the original feelings. \nWe become aware of the \nfeelings in our hand in terms of their meaning 1.ocated at the far \nend of the probe or stick, for it is to this end that we are attend-\ning. \nThis happens also when we learn to use a tool. \nWe attend to \nthe meaning of its impact on our hands ~n terms of its effects on \nthe things to which we are applying it and thus make these effects \nincreasingly meaningful, \nWe may recognise in this the semantic \npowers of tacit knowing, \n.. \nThe v1ay. the skilful use of a tool_ or probe makes us feel the \nmeaning of their impact on our hand at the far end of these instru-\nments, reflects a general tendency for meaning to be displaced away \nfrom us. \nThis is in fact my justification for using the terms. 'prox-\nimal' and \n1distal 1 to describe the first and the second term of \ntacit knowing. \nLet me return, with this in mind, to the mechanism of visual \nperception. \nI have mentioned the well known fact that the way we \n\n18 \nsee an object is mainly determined by our awareness of certain \nevents inside our body, which we cannot feel in themselves. \nWe are \naware of these processes inside our body in terms of position, size, \nshape and motion of an object, to which we are attenq.\u00b5:i:g; \u2022. In other \n\u00b7:-\u00b7:.-;\u2022r~,~ \u00b7\u00b7., \nwords,\" .. we are attending from these internal processes to,t'i1~i'quali-\n--\n. \n-,f;~~i\" \nties of things outside. \nThese qualities are what those :i.riternal \nprocesses~ to us \u2022. The transposition of bodily experiences into \n. \n\\ \nthe perception of things outside, may appear then as an instance of \nthe transposition of meaning at a distance which we found present \nin all tacit knowing, a.\"ld, most strikingly, in the use of tools and \nprobes . \n. \u00b7 - --- It may be thought that the feelings transposed in perception \n\u00b7, \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\\~ \ndif-fer from those transposed in the use of tools or .probes,. by \nbeing hardly noticeable before their transposition. \nAn answer--or \nat least part of an answer--is to be found in experiments extending \nsubception to subliminal stimuli. \nHefferline and collaborators have \nobserved (1959) that when spontaneous muscular twitches, unfelt by \nthe subject--but observeable by a million-fold amplification of \ntheir action currents--t1ere followed by brief cessation of an un-\npleasant noise, the subject responded by increasing the frequency \nof the twitches and thus silencing the noise for a longer time. \nExperiments carried out during the past decade in Soviet Russia have-\nshown this phenomenon in a different manner. (Razran 1961) \nWhen \nan internal stimulus, which the subject cannot notice in itself--\nsuch as the inflating of a rubber ball in the intestinal qanal--is \nrepeatedly followed by a reward or punishment, the internal stimulus \nwill come to arouse an anticipation of these events. \nWe have here \na process similar to that which I have postulated for explaining \n\n19 \nthat in the act of perception we become av1are of subliminal events \ninside our body in the way we see things outside, \nThis view of perception as a transposition of feelings--like \nthat observed in the use of.probes and in the proce9~~of subception--\n\u00b7. :\u00b7 ::_-,--:r ~\u2022-~~ . , \nis borne out by the fact that the capacity tci see exter?jla,l{pbjects \n< :~.,;~\"i..1.- <, \nis acquired, like the use of probes and the feats of subception, by \nan effort of learning which can be. laborious. \u00b7 \nModern\\philosophers, like Ryle, have argued that perception \ndoes not involve projection, since ~Te are not previously aware of \nthe internal processes which we are supposed to have projected into \nthe qualities of things perceived. \nDut we now have established that \n-projection of this very kind is presen~ in various instances of \ntacit knm;ing. \nMoreover, the fact that\" we do not originally sense \nthe-internal processes in themselves, now appears irrelevant. \n, \nI would venture, therefore, to extend the ocope of tacit \n\"-\nknowing to include the neural traces in the cortex of the nervous \nsystem. \nThis would place events going on inside our brain on the \nsame footing as the subliminal tv;itches operated by Hefferline 1s \nsubjects. \nThe re.lat ion of mind and bodJ' becomes then an instance \nof the relation between the two terms of tacit knowing. \nSuch a \nhypothesis does not explain how perceived sights, or any other states \nof consciousness, arise in conjunction with neural processes. It \nI' \nmerely applies the principle that wherever some process in our body \ngives rise to consciousness in us, our tacit knowing of the process \nwill mal<e sense of it in terms of an experience to which we are \nattending. \n' \nThis conception of the way the body participates in the act of \nperception, can be generalised to include the bodily roots of all \n\n20 \nknowledge and thought. It throws light then on the peculiar knowl-\nedge we have of our body by living in it. \nOur body is the only collection of things which we !mow almost \nexclusively by relying on our awareness of them for i\\\\1tending to \n. \n\u2022\u2022 \u00b7\u00b7-<\"!'\"' ~.---,:~ \n.. . ..... \n\"'., \nsomething else. \nParts of our body serve as tools for \u00b7ob,s~ry1ng \n\u00b7':'\u00a5.:;., \u00b7 \nobjects outside us and for manipulating these for purposes\u00b7 of our \nown, \nEvery time we make sense of the world we rely on our tacit \nknowledge of\\ impacts that the world makes on our body and of the \nresponse of our body to these impacts. \nSuch is the exceptional \nposition of our body in the universe. \nI have described how we learn to feel the end of a tool or a \nprobe hitting things outside. \nlie may regard this as the transforma-\ntion of the tool or probe into a sentietit extension of our body, \nDut our awareness of our body for attending to things outside it \nsuggests a wider generalisation of the feeling we have of our body. \n----\nHhenever we are using certain things for attending from them to \nother things (in the way we usually use our own body) these things \nchange their appearance. \nThey appear to us now in terms of the \nentities to which we are attending from them, in the same way as we \nfeel our own body in terms of things outside to which we are attend-\ning from our body, \nIn this sense\u00b7we can say that when we make some \nthings function as the proximal term of tacit knowing, we incorpo-\nrate these things in our body--or extend our body to include them. \nLet me show you at a glance the 1\u00b71orld-wide consequences of this \nconclusion. \nWe maim a thing function as the proximal term of a \ncomprehensive entity whenever we see it as part of a whole. \nvle have \nanalysed many instances of this kind: \nthe seeing of a solid body, \nthe discovery of relativity, the identification of physiognomies, \n\n21 \nthe practice of skills. \nWe could apply our present conclusions to \nall these, but I want to throw a quick glance over wider fields. \nDiology studies the shapes of living things and the way they grow \ninto these shapes from germ cells; it describes the ,qrga,ns of living \n.. \n. -:;,*.:.; \n.. \n~-:-: ;\" __ , \nthings and explains the way they function; it explores :t!)],,e. pnotor \n\u00b7\u00b7_.\u2022::-...-\nand sensory functions of animals and their intelligent performances. \nAll these are comprehensive entities. \nMorphology, physiology, \n\\ \nanimal psychology--they all deal with comprehensive entities. \nThe \nonly way to know them is to comprehend the coherence of their parts. \nThe structure of tacit knowing requires that we make these parts \nfunction as proximal terms, in the way we make our body function \nfor handling things outside. It requires that, in this sense, we \n\u00b7,. \ninteriorise these things in order to attend from them to the com-\nprehensive entity which they form. \nWe must dwell in them, and not \nobserve them in themselves, if we are to be aware of their bearing \non the entities to which they belong.\u00b7 Only thus can we understand \nthe way these comprehensive entities rely on their parts for per-\nforming their functions. \nThis adds another'important feature to the structure of tacit \nknowing. \nIt tells us what it is a ~nowledge of. \nWe may call this \nits ontolop;ical aspect. \nI look forward to showing you as I go on \nin these lectures that tacit knowing is in fact the sovereign in-\nstrument for establishing the existence of comprehensive entities \nand understanding their structure. \nAt the same time, looking baclc \non the process of' scientific discovery, we can see it confirmed \nhere that in tacit knowing we have found a means of establishing \ncoherence that clearly bears on reality. \n\n22 \nLet us realise now the peculiar position at which we have ar-\nrived. \n\\'le have seen the way tacit knowing establishes coherence \nby the powers of perception, conceptualisation, speculative imagina-\ntion and skilful effort. \nCompare this way of getting to know things \n1;;he acquisition of knowledge by \nof \n\u00b7:):~:~~-~ ..... ~ .. \nwith \na process \nexplicit,inference. \nl \n' . _t /'\u2022 \nIn both cases there are two terms involved. \nThe two te'\u00a3~i'of ex-\nplicit reasoning are its premises and its conclusions, those of \ntacit knowing are its proximal and its distal terms. \nExplicit rea-\n'\u2022 \nsoning subjects explicit premises to formal operations and thus \nreaches explicit conclusions. Tacit knowing leads from its proximal \nterm to its distal term by relying on the first for attending to \nthe second; it brings to bear the proximal on the distal, and es-\n, tablishes the_ latter as the meaning of ,,the former. \nThis is not done \nby a formal operation but by a process of integration striving for \n. \n'..:. \n-\nunderstanding. \nNor is its result a conclusion that can be detached \nfrom its logical antecBdents: \nwhen proximal things come to be un-\nderstood as particulars of an entity to which they contribute, ,~e \nremain aware of them in terms of this entity. \nExplicit inferenc~ is the ideal of critical reason, for it is \nopen to indefinitely repeated re-examination, bit by bit. \nYou can \nscrutinise each of the premises :).n turn, and likewise the several \noperations by which you derived your result from them. \nA return to \nthe antecedents of an act of comprehension is much more difficult.~ \nand uncertain. It involves an analysis of tacitly known particulars, \nwhich--as ,\u00b71e have seen--may not be identifiable, and also the revis-\ning of an act of integration, guided by undefinable harmonies. \n,\\n \nexplicit inference can therefore be refuted by bringing up new \nevidence against it, while a tacit interpretation of clues, may not \n\n23 \nbe shaken by facts that conflict i\u00b7rith it. \nWe may actually know a \nperception to be illusory, and yet find that our eyes continue to \npresent it to us. \nScience has set us an ideal of critical exacti~e,pe, which would \n.\u00b7 ::.'\"<:!'\"~\u2022-;,{\u2022 \nelimii;iate such hazards and this ideal may well seem to rep:r~sent \n,\\R~f~ \nour intellectual duty. \nFor the immense superiority of human intel-\nligence over that of the animal is due entirely to our capacity for \nexplicit thought. \nJean Piaget confirms the ideal of explicit infer-\n.. \nences in his Psycholologie de 1 1Intelligence and other writings, \nwhen he demonstrates the growth of intelligence in maturing children \nin terms of the replacement of senso-motoric knowing by formal \noperations of the mind, \nHe calls this a development from irrever-\nsible n:ental acts to reversible modes of inference. \nSo taken is \nthe great master by this growing mechanical efficiency of the mind, \n. \n' \nthat he fails to deal with the fact that the irreversible acts of \nthe mind include all its creative functions. \nMost writers on scientific knowledge express a similar prefer-\nence for explicit thought by refusing to deal with the tacit process \nof discovery, which th~y assign to psychology or sociology. \nDut I \ncannot see how a theory of knowledge can ignore the main process by \nwhich new knowledge is obtained ..

    "content_html": "<p>Commitment to Science by Michael Polanyi (,ls delivered on February 24, 1964 at Duke University) first&#x27; &#x27;.t&#x27;~o ... 1,ect ures -~\u00b7\u00b7 ~!&#x27;:- :-&#x27; You may well find the conclusions of my distressing. If there is one thing in which all philo~.~~hers have agreed, all the way from Plato via Descartes to .Gilbert:Ryle, it is, that if we make a statement of fact we should know exactly what \\ we mean and\u00b7 be able to tell on what grounds we affirm it. Now, in my first lecture I concluded that, not only can we not possibly know exactly what a statement of ours means, but that an attempt to make quite sure that we know it, would deprive the statement \u00b7 from a bearing on reality and hence.from having any meaning at all. To be meaningful, a statement must be substantially indeterminate. The second lecture was equally d1sappoiriting about the possibility of telling exactly on what grounds we make any statement, even a simple statement of fact. For we are alv,ays relying :for our obser- vation of things to which we are attending on our awareness of many things to which we are not _attending, some of them subliminal, and in any case, largely unidentifiable. 1\\nd this shortcoming too ap- peared to be incorrigible, For I gave you examples suggesting that &#x27; an attempt to remedy this condition radically might :render us help- less, as a person would be, who would insist on using explicit directions for finding his way about when wearing inverting spec- ,,. tacles, or as the rider of a bicycle would be, who would insist on explicitly solving the equation for finding the curvature\u00b7 of the path which will compensate his momentary imbalance at his present velocity. \\&#x27;le must know the elements on which we rely in these</p>\n<p>2 cases, and the operations by which we integrate them, internally. We must rely on them in the way we rely on parts of our body for making sense of the world--namely by dwelling in them. It is true that I did not discourage you from making state- \u00b7-~--\u00b7:\u00b7--r~, .... :, ments,\u00b7 which, by bearing on reality, were bound to ant/i~,(i\u00b1~~ inex- haustible implications, nor from tacitly interiorising clues which would reveal coherences in nature about which such statements could be made. On the contrary, I said that this manner of finding the truth was not only intrinsic to the use of our senses, but, far , beyond that, was the very path to discovery\u00b7in science. Dut such a strange recommendation must at least be argued sys- -tematically, from first principles.,. _ Let us examine the ideal of the \u00b7e-~act sciences and see whether we could not return to this. The ideal of the exact sciences is a mathematical theory of the universe. Such a theory would, no doubt, ..... be vastly elaborate, but it would yet have one very simple property. It could be wholly represented in one plane. All its data, however numerous, all its formulae, however complex, could be written on one single immense blacl,board. Dut remember the structure of tacit knowing; how we tacitly attend from a set of particulars to their joint meaning, a meaning which tends always to be displaced further away, beyond its particulars--which is of course why we described such particulars a&amp; the proximal term and their meaning as the distal term of tacit knowing. These t1\u00b710 terms are aligned radially outwards and along this line the kno1\u00b71er enters and partic_ipates in that which he knows. Dut the ideal of a comprehensive mathematical theory of the world requires that. all such tacit knowledge should be completely formalised, so that Vie could focus on each of the</p>\n<p>&quot; 3 data in question and explicitly relate them to each other. The radially aligned terms would have all to be flattened out into the plane of the giant blackboard. . \u00b7: ;:;-Y--&#x27;.I ,-1:s this theoretically possible? We must answer,:\u00b7t11~.\u2022 /J-11 mean- r ~:\u00b7&#x27;. iJ ing is established by understanding; and that to undersfa:nd is to integrate particulars into a significant entity, which can be achieved only by interiorising the particulars with a bearing on .... their joint meaning. Thus a theory becomes meaningful only if you interiorise it and get to see things in its terms. The theory can- not interpret itself and bring itself to bear on the facts of ex- perience: it can tell us something about experience only if~ have brought it to bear on experienc.e .. ,. This act always requires some degree of personal judgment and may require the highest scien- tific ability. Moreover, a theory can explain only something that is already knmm, though yet unexplained. The mathematical theory of a frog can explain the life of frogs only if frogs are non- theoretically known beforehand. This is true of any theory of things in nature. These things \u2022 must be identifiable without the theory, and the theory of these things can function as such onl? for a person who ccin identify these things and bring the theory to bear on them. If the theory applies to a class of things, the person must have a true conception of the class and be capable of subsuming a specimen under this conception. He will have to possess also a true understanding of the theory including the skill, trained by practice, for applying it. None of this knowledge and this skill is present in the theory, which can therefore only function by virtue of a framework of knowledge and skill that is external to it,</p>\n<p>4 The declared ideal of exact scientific knowledge, aiming at a strictly detached explicit theory of nature, proves logically untenable. I have said this already when drawing the distinction between explicit content of a physical theory and :il\\is;.: ai,.,t;icipatory ., ~:. :&quot;:\u00b7 powe&quot;rs which appeal to our imagination. I entered a c~f~Jt to warn you that the difference was only a matter of degree. For no mathe- matical formula means anything except as understood by him who ap- &#x27; plies it, &amp;nd such an act of understanding and applying is neces- sarily informal. You will find this confirmed in the foundations of mathematics as understood at present. The far flung enterprise of David Hilbert undertaken at the beginning of this ce,1tury, to establish mathematics as a set of &#x27;put&gt;ely formal operations, has failed. There is in mathematics a knowledge that cannot be made explicit; every time a formal deductive\u00b7 system is b,rought to bear on an interpretation of it, we evoke some of this tacit knowledge ~. contained in mathematics. It is evoked by attending from the formulae of mathematics to something eise that the formulae mean, or may mean. This is a process of tacit knovring which as such is continuous with the vray we know our body by living in it. It is a process of :\u2022 interiorisation. \\-le have seen cases before where explicit rules of inference were useless, unless interiorised. Right seeing throug)1 \u00b7 inverting spectacles which could not be arrived at by applying ex- plicit rules, was achieved by a process which tacitly applied these rules. The cyclist too, successfully used rules tacitly, which were useless when applied explicitly. :Jut ~Te have yet to see the actual process by which a formal system can be interiorised. It is</p>\n<p>5 worth loolring at an example of such a process. Take a manual for driving a motorcar and learn it by heart. Assuming that you have never seen a motorcar, you will have to identify it and its parts from the illustrations of.the manual. You can then&#x27;1-&amp;i.:!;..:1l.own at . .. \u00b7\u00b7 ~--:.&#x27; .\u00b7 the wheel and try to carry out the operations prescrilY,\u20ac\\4: ,i!iy the , ... \u00b7-:~. text. Thus you will start learning to drive and eventually estab- lish the bearing of the manual on all the objects it indicates and the skills\u00b7\u00b7 it teaches. We can observe here in detail the process of intelligent in- teriorisation by which an explicit directive is assimilated and made to function as a guide to a skilful performance, It is shifted to the back of the driver&#x27;s mind, so that he can attend from it to the road in front of him. If the traffic were slowed down a thousandfold, one could perhaps drive a motorcar by refer- , ring at each move to a manual, but one can guide split second deci- -- sions only by tacitly relying on it. Psychologists have observed that the number of objects to which we can explicitly attend at one time can hardly be more than ten. We see once more, what I &#x27; have already mentioned for the case of perceiving an object by integrating its sensory clues, that the richness and speed of tacit integration exceeds by far the powers of explicit adjustment carried out at the focus of attention. Dut again, we must realise that the difference between using a manual explicitly, which would be impracticable, and using it properly as interiorised at the back of our minds, is a- matter of degree: it is a difference between different depths of interiorisa- tion, No rule or conception, however explicitly applied, can have</p>\n<p>., any sense or use, except by functioning as an extension of our eyes and ears and muscles. 6 Here is a point which brings to the lips of philcisophers the name of Kant. He was the first to declare that exuernaJ..,.,i~xperience ., t..,.&#x27;;-!&quot; (._r is possible only by our participation in the act of kng.:rJ!ig. Dut the participation Kant postulated as the necessary condition of experience is very different from that which I am envisaging. It I was thought&#x27;\u00b7. to take place according to strict conceptual categories, which are necessarily fixed and leave neither need for intelligent effort nor scope for personal judgment. Hence Kantian legislation for experience is both infallible and impersonal, the knowing self \u00b7 is the recipient of \\{nowledge over &#x27;which he has no control. This is quite different from the process of tacit lcnowing by which we establish a coherence of clues jointly bearing\u00b7on a comprehensive entity and anticipate the inexhaustible manifestations of its real- ity, It is quite different from the process of interiorisation by which we achieve the capacity for attending from an interiorised theory to the experience on which we are bringing it to bear. These participations of ours&#x27;, which acquire dramatic force in the creative acts of the mind, are neither automatic nor infallible. They are - hazardous operations developed by training, the aptitude for which varies from what is native to all men, to such as possessed only by\u00b7 , genius. Dut to see this difference, is to recognise why Kant could not possibly accept the views I am putting forward here. The a:.:thor of the Critique of r~re Reason had come to rescue scientifi~ reason from the blight cast upon it by Hume&#x27;s scepticism and \u2022to gain for</p>\n<p>,I 7 ourselves 1 (as he wrote) &#x27;a possession \\&#x27;lhich can never again be contested, 1 He could not have accepted my recommendation for rely- ing on our lishing an , awareness of largely unidentifiable clues, for estab- . \u2022f\\1~-,; undefinably harmonious coherence, fraught.Wit;&#x27;ti,\u2022t\u00b51limited . \u00b7- -- ,. and perhaps unthinkable implications. . .-,.-&#x27;d\u00b7 It is, in .fact,,::rfu.ti-a posi- \u00b7 ... tion which readily commends itself to the scientific. mind of our culture. \\ Yet, had Kant only looked at his finger through a peep hole in a sheet of paper and moved the finger about, he would have seen that the transformation of raw sense impressions, which he called Anschauung, into the experience of an object, is a matter of degree, depending on the range of clues offered to our eyes. imd perhaps &#x27; . \u00b7\\~ he would have recognised then that the object itself, of which we .\u00b7 thus get a glimpse, is not a mere unknowable residue, a Ding an Sich, shorn of all it(!_ sensuous qualities, but something substantia~ point_ing beyond itself to its inexhaustible implications. - For in spite of being strictly resolved on firmly establishing the legitimate powers of reason, Kant here and there admitted in- cidentally, that into all acts of judgment there enters, and must enter, a personal decision vihich cannot be accounted .for by any rules. Kant says that no rules can ever determine exhaustively the operations of intelligence, for no system of rules can prescribe /&#x27; the procedure by which the rules themselves are to be applied. Of this ultimate agency which, unfettered by any explicit rules, de- cides on the subsumption of a particular instance under a general concept, Kant says only that it 1is 1\u00b71hat constitutes our so-called mother-wit 1. Indeed, at another point he declares the faculty neces-</p>\n<p>8 sary for the exercise of such judgment to be quite inscrutable. He says that the way our inte\u00b7111~ce t4&#x27;t&quot;ms and applies the schema of a class of particulars 1is a skill so deeply hidden in the human soul that employs 1 , we shall hardly guess the secret trick tli&#x27;Jt:i-la,iJ.ure here . \u2022.-\u00b7 ,~:..:::.;, We are told, in effect, that every time we sp&#x27;eak of dogs, trees or tables in general, or else identify something as a dog, a tree or a table, we are performing a secret trick which is \\. not likely ever to be revealed to our understanding. The formation of concepts and the subsumption of appropriate \u00b7 instances under a concept is in fact essentially a function of tacit knowing. Since every-member of an empirical set of objects differs from the other in every particular, the subsumption of such &#x27; -, .. objects under one title cannot be justified by any strictly formal- ised procedure, and the way in which it is nonetheless reliably carried out has long been a problem of philosophy. The solution ~ lies in recognising the powers of tacit knowing to present us with the joint meaning of an aggregate of disparate particulars. This resolves the ancient problem, what a man is like to whom \u2022 the concept of 1man 1 applies. How can he be both fair and dark, both young and old, brown, black and yellow at the se,me time? Or if he is neither of these, how can he be a man without any of the p!&#x27;operties of a man? The answer is that in speaking of man in general we are not attending to any particular man, but are relying on our tacit awareness of individual men, for attending to their j0int meaning. This meaning is a comprehensive entity. \u00b7rts knowl- ec.ge is wiped out by attending to its particulars in themselves and hence the concept of man cannot be identified with any mere aggregate .men, past or future.</p>\n<p>9 A class of natural objects, like dogs or men, is real, for the things that hang together in terms of such a class, may be ex- pected to hang together also in other altogether inexhaustible ways. \u2022 . , _,t,\u00b7-,,. This fact has always been clear, but it mistakenly&#x27;appea.t].ed inex- - . -... . t-:;&#x27;_\u2022, i., ,\u00b7 plicable, because it could not be accounted for by any:?-t!l:::,J&#x27;.i.icit mental operations. Kant rightly regarded, therefore, its under- standing to lie beyond the powers of his system. Moder~&#x27;philosophers regard conceptions, as nominalists have done since Abelard, as mere collections of objects designated by a common name and they would overcome the difficulty that such a name would designate an indefinite variety of disparate objects, by ascribing an &#x27;open texture&#x27; to the\u00b7conception going by such a &#x27; . \u00b7\\~ name. Dut this begs the question, how a designation can be applied with such openness as is required for covering:a11 the disparate members of a natural ~lass and yet be able reliably to exclude others that are not its members. The conception of natural classes cannot be understood without acl&lt;nowledging the powers of tacit know- ing. &#x27; For centuries past the systematic thinking of modern man has been based almost invariably on the. assumption that a process of inference must be explicit. Dut there have been important thinkers, since the last eighty years or so, who have anticipated parts of . . , t&#x27;.::e position I am trying to establish here ar..d to me their work Recms clearly to point in the direction which I am following here. About the turn of the last century, German thinkers postulated that indwelling is the proper means of knowing man and the humani- ties. Dilthey taught that the mind of a person can be understood</p>\n<p>10 only by reliving its workings and Lipps represented aesthetic appre- ciations as our entering into a work 6f art and thus dwelling in the mind of its creator. Dilthey and Lipps were right in saying that such knowledge can be achieved only by indwerl.-1ng. Dut my \u00b7\u00b7~ :~ .. ,-,y- ~~4?.\u2022 &#x27; &#x27;, analysis of tacit knowing shows that they\u00b7were mistaJi:en~1n affirm- . ,:~\\\u00bd~1.~ ing that this fact sharply distinguishes the humanities from the natural sciences. There is a continuous transition from indwelling in science, to the fuller participation of the knower in the study of literature and history. My conception of indwelling is more deeply affiliated to existentialism and to Husserl&#x27;s phenomenology. I am aiming, as Husserl did, at rescuing the reality of an essentially hierarchic universe from being flattened out by\u00b7a Laplacean analysis of the world. Dut I shall not try to unfold -the true structure of things, as Husserl tried, by excluding the question of their reality. Hus- -- serl ta.lrns over from .:Jrentano the intentionality of knowledge and enters thereby into lived experience. For him, intentionality creates the conditions for the objectivity of such experience. He thought, until the last part of his life, that, by excluding its bearing on reality, the analysis of such lived structures becomes unerring, transcendental. Dut when this dream dissolved, as he confessed, such structural analysis was reduced to subjectivity._ I&#x27; I shall show how my theory of knowledge tries, on the contrary,&#x27; to discipline intentionality by its bearing on reality. Husserl has proved so far the most influential th~nker of the twentieth century. As it became clear that knowledge of lived experience, which he was seeking, was knowledge possessed by indwell-</p>\n<p>11 ing, it transpired that it was a knowledge of being. So we arrive at Heidegger and French existentialism. From the theory of tacit knowing we can derive\u00b7,,the being-in- . : .. -,y--i~f\\&#x27; &#x27;., . . ~ -- the -Vlorld, the Dasein of man, as defined by Heidegger. \u2022~uFoi(&#x27; every &#x27;\u00b7:. \u20221: ........ 1 meaningful thought and action of ours interiorises particulars for the purpose of attending to their joint significance)and thus we populate the known world with comprehensive entities the elements of which function logically as parts of ourselves. Our being extends then over the range of our understanding. We have here Heidegger&#x27;s Field of Deing (as William Darrett has called it) and we discover its logical theory: which is that every act of compre- -,. hension shapes jointly our existence and our knowledge. Once interiorisation is accepted as intrinsic\u2022to knowing, an analysis of knowledge will keep bringing up various aspects of ...._ existence, and such observations will confirm the results of existentialist philosophy. Dut they will go beyond existentialism by revealing the logical structure of the observed existential commitments. Yet the existential elements-of human knowledge have a dif- ferent quality from the existential elements of human destiny. Man&#x27;s life and fate evoke a more intense and immediate interest _,, than does man&#x27;s knowledge of things. This may partly account for the difference between the perspectives into which being is fitted by the two enquiries. Heidegger brings out man&#x27;s being-in-the- world by confronting him with death which cancels his projects. To me, man&#x27;s striving for truer being and knowledge appears justified within a cosmic process of organic evolution leading on to responsi-</p>\n<p>ble manhood in a society of explorers, Yet a fundamental problem of existentialism, as formulated by Sartre, will be with us all the time, Throughout this enquiry I shall seek to answer the question on what grounds ~iJ&#x27;&#x27;-~po,ssibly . ., ....,... ,. justify a choice of existence; This puzzling query will be seen to be linked to the problem of discovery, For discovery presents us with a kindred paradox, \\ which has long been neglected, We shall approach it by asking our- selves once more: what is a problem? It is a commonplace that all research must start from a problem. Dut how can one see a problem? For to see a problem is to see some- thing that is hidden, It is to have an intimation of the coherence of hitherto not comprehended particulars. To see a problem that will lead to a great discovery is not only to anticipate something hidden, but to see something of which the rest of humanity cannot -~ have an inkling. All this is commonplace; we take it for granted, without noticing the clash of self-contradiction entailed in it, Yet Plato has&#x27;pointed out this contradiction in the Meno. He says . that to search for the solution of a problem is an absurdity; for either you know what you are looking for, and then there is no problem; or you do not know what you are looking for, and then you are not looking for anything and cannot expect to find anything. ,-\u00b7 The solution which Plato offered for this paradox was that all discovery is a remembering of past lives. This explanation has hardly ever been accepted, but neither has any other solution been offered for avoiding the contradiction. So we are faced with the fact that for two thousand years and more, humanity has progressed</p>\n<p>13 by the efforts of people solving difficult problems, while all the time it could be shown that to do this was either meaningless or impossible. For the Meno is essentially right. It points to the \u00b7t ~\\{~.; ~ .. ~:, fac,.t that so long as we think of knowledge. as having a,.:-&#x27;cleterminate : };ttj}:&#x27; content, the conception of a problem is self-contradictory and the .. achievement of discovery is incomprehensible. For discovery is an act of tacit knowing, guided by an anticipation of its achievement \u2022 . ,, Whenever we come to understand something, we must pass a stage when we have partly understood it. When things are understood at a glance, as when we recognise familiar objects in a well lit room, we shall not be able to catch an imperfect stage of understanding. Dut think of long-dravm efforts to see things through inverting spectacles. Any incomplete stage of such an exertion must be filled with a striving towards its completion, even though this will re- quire the invention,of a novel way of seeing, never experienced before. A problem is then the partial comprehension of a coherence, striving for its co~summation. An intellectual appetite responds here, like all appetites, to a potential increment of its own satis- faction. The pursuit of a proJ:&gt;lein feels its way towards discovery, by sensing the growing proximity of discovery. The two terms of tacit knowing are radially aligned so that&gt; the knower projects himself along this line into that which he knows. The pursuit of discovery extends this projection over a sequence of stages, each successive stage being achieved by an act of tacit knowing based on the stage that preceded it. Thus the vectorial character of tacit knowing is intensified into a sustained drive</p>\n<p>14 on the trail to discovery. From our experience of the way tacit knowing is achieved in making out what we see or in trying to feel our way with a stick, we may expect such an effort to 1) The effort will consist have the following &#x27;d!iaT&lt;;t~,t&quot;,ristics. . . .. ~:.:\u00b7i, in trying to attend fro~c~f&#x27;. set of \u00b7 .. .,. . proximal particulars to their unl&lt;nown joint meaning. These particu- lars are interiorised and not attended to in themselves; they may \\ &#x27;\u00b7 indeed be subliminal. They usually cannot be fully specified and sometimes not even approximately identified. 2) The relation by which they will be integrated into a com- prehensive entity will be physiognomic or skilful and hence vir- tually undefinable. - , 3) When eventually integrated to such an entity, their appear- ance will assume a new quality, never experienced before. Great discoveries will tend to show a high degree of indeter- -.._ minacy in all three respects: in the choice of data, in the mode - of their integration and the novel quality of the result. Remember the origins of relativity in the puzzling question whether a moving light source could overtal&lt;e a beam emitted by it. Such a problem is wide open; Einstein has described the decade during which it was gestated. &quot;During all these years&quot; he wrote, &quot;there was a feeling of direction, of going straight towards something concrete. It 1~_-, of course, very hard to express that feeling in words; but it was decidedly the case, and clearly to be distinguished from later con- siderations about the rational forms of the solution. 11 This long drive towards something concrete which had yet no rational form, was a tacit effort to achieve coherence, and its result was a</p>\n<p>15 comprehensive conceptual innovation, transforming the appearance of the world. The creation of a new inter:r;:,retative framework transforms the mind of him who achieves it. Only a new forcible interiorisation of elementary features can bring about such a rebirt1ii.:.:::01&#x27; .. ,our intel\u2022- ., t,;;&quot;~ i :&#x27; lectual selves. The problem which has led to such a re:~{ must . ;~ have anticipated an existential change. Relativity not only changed our interpretative framework, but also contributed to a shift in our standa;ds of intellectual valuation towards an appreciation or more abstractly mathematical harmonies. Discovery must the:r&#x27;efore have been striving to\u00b7wards new kinds of intellectual beauty, more satisfying to our transformed intellectual selves. We have here the characteristic features of supreme original- ity. A new comprehensive coherence is achieved, having a -novel appearance and mal,ing us see the world i 0 n a new way&#x27;.\u2022 It involves a change of ourselves by making us interiorise a new interpretative - framework and adopt novel standards of intellectual excellence.\u00b7 Such deliberate self transformation may raise the question on what grounds we can possibly justify such a change of our identity. Could it be that man can in fact choose his own values, as Sartre and before him Nietzsche ,~ould have. him do? We are brought up here sharply against the full significance of the dilemma with which I presented you in recommending a path ,~ &#x27; to discovery starting from the unexamined acceptance of unspecifi- able grounds and aiming at a result distinguished by its vague and inexhaustible implications, All that I have said since then about the foreknowledge that would guide us along such\u00b7a path and of the</p>\n<p>16 self transformation involved in any major success of it, only adds to the questionable character of such an enterprise. I accept the charge, but for the moment I shall counter it only by saying with Kierl&lt;egaard, &quot;Either Or&quot;--look tive. &quot; There are ways of advancing knowledge without navigating over seas of fantastic indeterminacies. Some problems can be solved by &#x27; merely surveying all possible solutions. Existentially, surveying is the opposite extreme to the creative solving of major problems. To map out a country by triangulation, to extend the geography of the heavens by photography, or to follow through a series of sys- tematic variations in the conditi.ons of. an experiment, is an ex- \u00b7\u2022.~ plicitly prescribed mode of extending kno~ledge. It requires a minimum of indwelling, and thus approaches as closely as possible, the ideal of scientific detachment. It does not involve us per- sonally, as the moulding of our minds into the comprehension of a hidden meaning. In fact, it presents no problems to torment us, evokes no hunches to excite us, offers no triumphs and causes no surprises. Dut consequently, it is dull, it is soul killing: detestable to minds gifted for creative tasks. And it is sterile. So let us return, after all, to the pursuit of discovery with all its vagaries. A good problem is an anticipation of a hidden truth and its clues represent an aspect of the future discovery to be made by solving the problem; to recognise a problem is to discern.an aspect of a hidden truth, not visible to others, less sensitive to the tell-tale traces of a pattern in nature. Yet, often when I lecture</p>\n<p>17 on the precious knowledge contained in a good problem, and of the special gifts needed to recognise a good problem, my audience would suggest that problems consist simply in observing something that seems to contradict the hitherto accepted laws of nature. This is . \u00b7t\\:;:~\u00b7-,, - a far&quot;. too narrow view of wh.at constitutes a problem; ~-;nre,)-ejko it --&quot;u:,r- begs the question which it disposes of. For to recognise~ a good problem in an apparent deviation from the currently accepted laws of nature, .is to judge, and rightly judge, that the deviation is &#x27;\u00b7 real and that it is also important and likely to be capable of elucidation. Such judgments require the very kind of scientific insight which I have said to be necessary for recognisii1g any good problem. Take the case of extra sensory perception. Some scientists regard these observations as pointing to an important problem, while others prefer to set the evidence aside, believing that there is nothing in it. The questio~ possibly one of greatest importance, remains open. Similar questions face the working scientist. time and again. InexpJ.icable things keep turning up in a laboratory and are brushed aside ~s dirt-effects. One risks thus to ignore important clues. Dequerel discovered radioactivity and Rontgen discovered X-rays by inquiring ipto\u00b7the fogging of photographic plates which they might have set aside as insignificant accidents. Dut to enquire ir.to every inexplicable observation ,,ould be to undertake a succession of wild goose chases. Scientists must un- ceasingly discri:ninate betweE:n significant facts which may present a problem and accj_dental events not fj_t for investiga&#x27;.;ion. A wrong choice may be fateful.while an exceptionally good choice may prove</p>\n<p>18 a mark of genius. We must realise also, that for a working scientist to accept a problem as his subject, means to engage in an enterprise. All the conditions of this enterprise must be assessed-,b~..):\u00b5,Jll. It is ., ~:-~ : \u00b7-&#x27; not &#x27;enough that his problem should point to a potentia~.;.discovery \u2022 . \u00b7 &#x27;.\u00b7 It had been known for a long time that in the periodic system the sequence of two pairs of elements was inverted. This was eventually &#x27; explained by Moseley&#x27;s discovery of atomic numbers equal to the charge of the nucleus. Dut any enquiry into this question before Moseley&#x27;s study of X-ray spectra would have been a waste of time. A problem is good only if it is ripe. It must be feasible; and this \u00b7means, feasi.ble by the scientist . . \u00b7\\~ who considers to undertake its pursuit.. He must be able to assess his 011n powers, his special gifts and resources as a means i&#x27;or solving the problem. He must assess also whether the chances of discovery and the importance of a prospective discovery are such as to justify the investment of his powers. A lesser use or them would be almost as wasteful as their application to a problem which will prove insoluble,&#x27; Most working scientists can bitterly remem- ber suffering both kinds of waste; These requirements may appear extravagant. To assess jointly the prospects of all the clues 1-rhich point to a problem, its soun,s:1..: ness and ripeness, its feasibility in view of the scientist&#x27;s special faculties and resources, and its importance compared with any alternative use of these faculties, may seem to be beyond the power of any mind. They are, of course, far beyond the power of any explicit evaluation. The number of objects to which we can ex-</p>\n<p>19 plicitly attend, even though only to estimate their number, will in the simplest experimental conditions be hardly more than ten. Dut the variety and number of items that can be tacitly integrated to a decision is vast. Remember, once more, the split~-~econd deci- .\u00b7.:~\u00b7- - \u00b7r~l I J sions&#x27; of a skilful driver, compared with someone car by referring to a detailed prescription. Or tryin$,tl.to:\u00b7drive a . \u00b7\u00b7: &#x27;&#x27;.i-,.. ~ think of the num- berless clues combined at every moment in watching an object moving about in front of us. It is by his powers of tacit integration that the scientist can swiftly combine and appraise the many disparate clues and resources which might contribute to his enquiry. Such acts of tacit integration that are vital both to the in- ception and conduct of scientif:Lc \u00b7enquiry, ar&amp; obliterated by achieving success. Once solved, a problem can never puzzle us again. Steps which required exceptional penetration and imagina- tive powers, may well appear obvious. Looking back today on the year 1923 when de Droglie put forward the wave theory of&#x27; matter, it would seem obvious that it would be tested by looking f&#x27;or the dif&#x27;- f&#x27;raction of electron beams by crystals in analogy to the diff&#x27;raction of X-rays. Im element&#x27;ary computation would have shown that beams of right wave length could easily be obtained. Yet I have told you how astounded we were, when two years after de Droglie 1s theory was published, Elsasser first suggested such a possibility. When, even- ,,. tually, another two years later Davison and Germer in America and G. P. Thomson in England actually produced such dif&#x27;f&#x27;raction patterns, this was still regarded as a feat of&#x27; sufficient originality, to secure the Nobel prize to its authors. Intellectual passions, like bodily passions, are abated by</p>\n<p>20 their satisfaction. It needs the art of a novelist, like Arthur Koestler, to revive in our imagination the years of Kepler&#x27;s strug- gle with the wanderings of the planet Mars, which would accord with no reasonable The fact combination of steady circular motions-,&gt;-\u00b7\u2022 \u00b7-:.~:,-~-t-~~~~ :.&#x27; that a completed act of tacit knowing ob~;h~~f_a.tes its antecedents assists those current theories of discovery w_hich would ignore tacit powers of the mind or set them aside as none of their business. The corresponding tendency to explain discovery, as far as possible, by explicit operations was systematically misleading. The scientist straining his tacit powers in pursuit of discovery, is immersed in what he does. The interiorisation of clues, the groping for intellectual harmonies,&quot; the passionate anticipation of a still hidde\u00b7n truth of which these harmonies are the tokens, in- volve his whole person. A theory that ignores the mechanism of tacit knowing must ignore or deny these commitments. The scientist&#x27;s commitments\u00b7 are minimised also by giving a false impression of the fact, that he is prepared to abandon any particular hunch, if it proved false. The tentativeness of his every step is taken to&#x27; show that he is uncommitted. Dut in an im- portant sense every step taken in tJ:ie conduct of research is defini- tive, for it definitely disposes of the time, the effort and the resources used up in making it. This is no small matter, for these - .&lt;&#x27; investments add up with frightening rapidity to the whole profes-- sional life of those engaged in research, and i1ill exhaust even before this the credit of a scientist responsible for conducting scientific enquiries. To thin\\{ of scientific workers cheerfully trying this and trying that, calmly changing course at each failure,</p>\n<p>21 is totally misleading. The researcher&#x27;s position is more like that of the chess player, who has only a short time for making his next irrevocable move. This applies to all kinds o.f moves: to the adQP:!;ion of a prob- \u00b7-:- \u00b7:\u00b7~&lt;J&quot;&quot; -~.-... :, ... \u00b7, ~ :.r lem, the acceptance of a hypothesis for testing it and to\u00b7t;he claims , ~~\\H,..:. i ~ made for the final result in publishing it. It is wideiyadmitted today that hypotheses arise by intuition. Dut we must consider that &#x27; unless a hypothesis has a fair chance of proving true, or at least partly true, it is useless. Unless the ideas which a scientist will undertake to test have a chance of at least one in ten to succeed, he would waste more than nine months out of ten in fruitless test- ing. He would not last long in his, profession. Considering the \u00b7,. number of conceivable ideas that might be suggested at each stage, a faculty which can produce a valid surmise at least in one try out of ten, must be credited with the power of discovery, To describe this power as\u00b7intuition, and set it aside as such, is to set aside what is essential to discovery at all stages. For at every step the same powers of tacit knowing carry on the deepening of our in- sight, which eventually results in discovery. A scientist&#x27;s claim to a discovery is a personal commitment and in accepting his claim, the scientific community shares and the lay public shares too, at second hand, this commitment. necent ,. literature has tried to make the justification of such a commitment easier, by saying that science does not claim certainty for its results and puts them forward only as probable. Dut thinl&lt; of the way you can wipe out all oppositic~ if in an argument you can declare, tha.t something has been proved by science. We have as</p>\n<p>22 much confidence in the laws of nature as affirmed by science, as we have in any human utterance. If this is not certainty, then there is no such thing, and the word is meaningless. In any case, the question, on what grounds we accord such great confHlep.c;_e, as we ... \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7*\u2022&#x27; .. ~ .. :..:: , , do, to the teachings of science remains the same, wheth~f:t~is \u2022 \u00b7, &#x27;! :-.,,. ~ confidence attributes certainty or probability to science; To minimise the claims of science in order to reduce the prob- lem of our acceptance of science, we are told also that science is merely tentative, always ready to move on to a new position, if challenged by new evidence. Dut this again is beside the point. However ready we are to move on, we shall always be at some place at any particular moment. Existential-ism and the modern theory of choice have both taught us to acknowledge that the choice to do nothing, or to go on trying, is as irrevocable as a decision to act. Declarations to accept the theories of science only tentative- ly, are, in fact, merely verbal. They attempt to avoid our actual commitment, by a fiction which, were it\u00b7true, would be irrelevant. The fact remains, that we grant our confidence to the theories of science without any&#x27;formal proof of its Justification. \\&#x27;Je com- mit ourselves in the light of our p~rsonal judgment. Let me sum up in preparation for my final argument. From the moment when the scientists first surmised that there was something - there that was puzzling; through the stage where he fixed on this as a definite problem; through the pursuit of successive hunches that arose from this problem; to the dawning of discovery and the public affirmation of its claims; we have seen the same urge of comprehension seeking to exercise its powers and groping for the</p>\n<p>23 direction in which they are increasingly satisfied, but still leaving open, when crowned by a discovery, a degree of incomplete- ness which is accepted as a token of yet unseen implications,to be \u2022!y~.:~-~,-~:,i .. t,;:&#x27;.&quot;:: :.&#x27;&#x27; revealed one day to others, who will follow after. .r12:~-}t The predominance of our tacit faculties in shapirig:ehe course of discovery and stamping its conclusion with our personal satis- faction is now clearly established. Dut does this achievement not &#x27; &#x27;\u00b7, open at our feet once more the abyss of self-doubt, in the very terms in which I opened this lecture? We seem to be left up in the air, with nothing to keep us up there, except a firm hold on our own boot straps. However, I should hope that scienc;e itself might provide us with a more substantial principle of levitation. &#x27;.rhere is an as- pect of our self reliance in the pursuit of science, which we yet have to bring fully tQ bear on our situation. A scientist&#x27;s ori- ginality lies in seeing a problem where others see none and finding a way to its pursuit, where others lose their bearings. These acts of his mind are strictly personal in the sense that they are attri- butable to him and only to him. Dut they derive their power and receive their guidance from an aim that is strictly impersonal. For his quest pre-supposes the existence of an external reality. Re- search is conducted in these terms from the start and continues td&#x27; grope for a hidden truth towards which our clues are pointing; and the discovery which terminates the pursuit and satisfies its author, is still sustained by a vision of reality pointing beyond it. This is why even the most original ideas of a scientist en- gaged in research, still stand under an impersonal discipline. He</p>\n<p>24 can put forward a scientific problem only in the conviction that there is something there to be discovered, something real over which he has no control, and this fills him with a compelling sense of responsibility for the pursuit o:J: a hidden truth, wh:J.ch demands his &#x27; ~-:.-:c:r \u00b7~\u00b7~~\u00b7 &#x27;. services for revealing it. He exercises a personal ju~_fyft only in adducing evidence of an external reality. Hence, however ori- ginal may be a scientist&#x27;s way of conducting his research, however passionate \u00b7~nd solitary his vision, there is no trace in these of self-indulgence. The satisfaction of originality lies in the in- tensely personal character of a triumphantly universal result. There is, admittedly, great personal satisfaction to be found in successful scientific research \u2022. D~t such pleasure is legitimate only if it is derived from a valid purii&#x27;uit of discovery: subjective satisfaction can never be the proper aim.of originality. It seems wrong, therefore, to describe the personal element in scientific originality, as subjective. A problem, a clue, a hunch, a dis-. covery--they all contain an element that is personal; the whole heuristic process is personal, yet its significance is not subjec- tive, for it consists in anticipating some part of the truth yet to be discovered, which when discoyered will point beyond itself to reality. To meet this situation, I have coined the term Personal I&lt;nowl- - ,, edge. I have described as tacit knowing the less intensely personal form of indwelling, the most striking feature of which lay in its unspecifiability. TJy passing on to scientific enquiry and to dis- . coveries of great originality, we meet with a more dynamic !mowing to which the distinctive powers of the knm\u00b7rer make a decisive con-</p>\n<p>25 tribution. Here the term &quot;personal knowledge&quot; becomes more appro- priate. All tacit knowing is an indwelling which mentally extends the \u00b7! \\:;~ -, .\u2022 know~r, enlarges his existence and raises hi_s sense\u00b7 g::r-\u00b7~tional being; but only in its major enterprises does this expJrtiibn become fervid. Here we see scientists not merely puzzled, but &#x27;obsessed by a problem; here are hunches which grip his mind suddenly with -.. violent hopes; where discovery comes. as a triumph to its,author and a dazzling surprise to his audience. These emotions are part of our having problems and hunches, and making discoveries. They account for the dynamic powers by which problems are grasped and pursued, hunches are hit upon and deveJoped, discoveries are sighted .\u2022 &#x27; and established. J\\11 major enquiry must be motivated throughout by these heuristic passions and be guided at every step by seel{ing to satisfy them. ~ These passions differ from those stirred up by our bodily needs. They are generous desires which do not deprive others in any share of that whi~h gre.tifies them, but spread widely what they enjoy, by the very act of enjoying it. They teach their own pleas- ures and perpetuate themselves by their own fulfilment. Man in &#x27; . thought strives to give life to thought. His anticipation of pos- sible ideas urges him to force his way into them and thus come tc;&gt;t&#x27; participate in a deeper coherence never yet entered before. Highest originality is manifested in the capacity to transform one 1s own outlook on the world, \\\u00b7le may create new standards of beauty by serving them. This is how a choice of existence takes place in science, as it does elsewhere too. The existentialist</p>\n<p>26 dilemma, how values created at our command can bind us, does not arise, Admittedly, explicit determination cannot create new stand- ards. If you regard a choice of&#x27; values as you would of a choice of a menu, you cannot expect to find that these valuei1&#x27;hav.~,,authority .. . ..,\u00b7, ~~ i:.&#x27; over\u00b7 you. Dut originality is no explicit choice. Ori~4~a&#x27;.:lity, . &#x27; which alone can establish new values, accepts their authority in the very act of creating them, \\ Since &#x27;\u00b7a scientist may put forward his conclusions only if he trusts that they arise from a true understanding of experience in its bearing on reality, he holds that others, equipped as he is, must reach the same conclusion. Such is the universal intent of a scientific discovery. Having relied :throughout his enquiry on the presence of something hidden out there, the scientist must continue to rely on that external presence for the validity ~f the result that satisfies his quest, As he has accepted throughout the dis- cipline which this external pole of his heuristic endeavour imposed upon him, he cannot but expect that others will recognise likewise the impersonal authority that guided him. On the grounds of the &#x27; self discipline which bound him to objectivity, he must claim that his results are universally valid;. He knows not whether his claims will be accepted; they may be true and yet fail to carry conviction, He may even know that this _,. is likely to happen. Nor does eventual acceptance guarantee truth, To claim universal validity for a statement says merely that it ought to be accepted by all. The affirmation of scientific truth has an obligatory character which it shares with other valuations deemed to be universal,</p>\n<p>27 Doth the anticipation of discovery and discovery itself, may turn out to be a delusion. Dut it is futile to seek for strictly impersonal criteria of their validity, as philosophies of science have been trying to do. To accept the pursuit of science as a . \u00b7l )~~-:;;; .:;-,.:,,~4 reasonable, successful, enterprise is to share the ki-nd &#x27;of\u2022 \u00b7commit- . -t~-tt ~ t ;\u00b7 ment on which scientists enter by undertaking this entei~prise. You cannot formalise the act of commitment, for you cannot express your commitment ~on-commitally. To attempt this is to exercise the kind of lucidity which destroys its subject matter, We should be glad to recognise instead that science has come into existence by powers of anticipation akin to those on which all hopes for truth and beauty are grounded, and that science rests &#x27; .. ~ ultimately on such intangible powers of&#x27; the mind. If this.leaves science up in the air, it will keep us c9mpany there. It will restore our confidence in convictions, which its supposed exacti- tude and detachment h~s undermined so long. The current ideals or science are false and misleading. Thes~ ideals were invented for the benefit of physicists, who flourish by disregarding them, and they play havoc with o_ther branches of science and with the humani- ties, who venerate them. These false ideals will be well lost for a truer image of science, which will allow us once more to place \u00b7 first things first.: the living above the inanimate, man above the animal, and man&#x27;s duties above man.</p>",
    "content_text": "Commitment to Science \nby Michael Polanyi \n(,ls delivered on February 24, 1964 at Duke University) \nfirst' '.t'~o ... 1,ect ures \n-~\u00b7\u00b7 \n~!':- :-' \nYou may well find the conclusions of my \ndistressing. If there is one thing in which all philo~.~~hers have \nagreed, all the way from Plato via Descartes to .Gilbert:Ryle, it \nis, that if we make a statement of fact we should know exactly what \n\\ \nwe mean and\u00b7 be able to tell on what grounds we affirm it. Now, in \nmy first lecture I concluded that, not only can we not possibly \nknow exactly what a statement of ours means, but that an attempt \nto make quite sure that we know it, would deprive the statement \n\u00b7 from a bearing on reality and hence.from having any meaning at all. \nTo be meaningful, a statement must be substantially indeterminate. \nThe second lecture was equally d1sappoiriting about the possibility \nof telling exactly on what grounds we make any statement, even a \nsimple statement of fact. \nFor we are alv,ays relying :for our obser-\nvation of things to which we are attending on our awareness of many \nthings to which we are not _attending, some of them subliminal, and \nin any case, largely unidentifiable. \n1\\nd this shortcoming too ap-\npeared to be incorrigible, \nFor I gave you examples suggesting that \n' \nan attempt to remedy this condition radically might :render us help-\nless, as a person would be, who would insist on using explicit \ndirections for finding his way about when wearing inverting spec-\n,,. \ntacles, or as the rider of a bicycle would be, who would insist on \nexplicitly solving the equation for finding the curvature\u00b7 of the \npath which will compensate his momentary imbalance at his present \nvelocity. \n\\'le must know the elements on which we rely in these \n\n2 \ncases, and the operations by which we integrate them, internally. \nWe must rely on them in the way we rely on parts of our body for \nmaking sense of the world--namely by dwelling in them. \nIt is true that I did not discourage you from making state-\n\u00b7-~--\u00b7:\u00b7--r~, .... :, \nments,\u00b7 which, by bearing on reality, were bound to ant/i~,(i\u00b1~~ inex-\nhaustible implications, nor from tacitly interiorising clues which \nwould reveal coherences in nature about which such statements could \nbe made. On the contrary, I said that this manner of finding the \ntruth was not only intrinsic to the use of our senses, but, far \n, \nbeyond that, was the very path to discovery\u00b7in science. \nDut such a strange recommendation must at least be argued sys-\n-tematically, from first principles.,. _ \nLet us examine the ideal of the \u00b7e-~act sciences and see whether \nwe could not return to this. \nThe ideal of the exact sciences is a \nmathematical theory of the universe. \nSuch a theory would, no doubt, \n..... \nbe vastly elaborate, but it would yet have one very simple property. \nIt could be wholly represented in one plane. \nAll its data, however \nnumerous, all its formulae, however complex, could be written on \none single immense blacl,board. \nDut remember the structure of tacit \nknowing; how we tacitly attend from a set of particulars to their \njoint meaning, a meaning which tends always to be displaced further \naway, beyond its particulars--which is of course why we described \nsuch particulars a& the proximal term and their meaning as the \ndistal term of tacit knowing. \nThese t1\u00b710 terms are aligned radially \noutwards and along this line the kno1\u00b71er enters and partic_ipates in \nthat which he knows. \nDut the ideal of a comprehensive mathematical \ntheory of the world requires that. all such tacit knowledge should \nbe completely formalised, so that Vie could focus on each of the \n\n\" \n3 \ndata in question and explicitly relate them to each other. \nThe \nradially aligned terms would have all to be flattened out into the \nplane of the giant blackboard. \n. \n\u00b7: ;:;-Y--'.I \n,-1:s this theoretically possible? \nWe must answer,:\u00b7t11~.\u2022 /J-11 mean-\nr ~:\u00b7'. iJ \ning is established by understanding; and that to undersfa:nd is to \nintegrate particulars into a significant entity, which can be \nachieved only by interiorising the particulars with a bearing on \n.... \ntheir joint meaning. \nThus a theory becomes meaningful only if you \ninteriorise it and get to see things in its terms. \nThe theory can-\nnot interpret itself and bring itself to bear on the facts of ex-\nperience: it can tell us something about experience only if~ \nhave brought it to bear on experienc.e .. ,. This act always requires \nsome degree of personal judgment and may require the highest scien-\ntific ability. \nMoreover, a theory can explain only something that \nis already knmm, though yet unexplained. \nThe mathematical theory \nof a frog can explain the life of frogs only if frogs are non-\ntheoretically known beforehand. \nThis is true of any theory of things in nature. \nThese things \n\u2022 \nmust be identifiable without the theory, and the theory of these \nthings can function as such onl? for a person who ccin identify these \nthings and bring the theory to bear on them. \nIf the theory applies \nto a class of things, the person must have a true conception of the \nclass and be capable of subsuming a specimen under this conception. \nHe will have to possess also a true understanding of the theory \nincluding the skill, trained by practice, for applying it. None of \nthis knowledge and this skill is present in the theory, which can \ntherefore only function by virtue of a framework of knowledge and \nskill that is external to it, \n\n4 \nThe declared ideal of exact scientific knowledge, aiming at a \nstrictly detached explicit theory of nature, proves logically \nuntenable. \nI have said this already when drawing the distinction \nbetween explicit content of a physical theory and :il\\is;.: ai,.,t;icipatory \n., \n~:. :\":\u00b7 \npowe\"rs which appeal to our imagination. \nI entered a c~f~Jt to warn \nyou that the difference was only a matter of degree. \nFor no mathe-\nmatical formula means anything except as understood by him who ap-\n' \nplies it, &nd such an act of understanding and applying is neces-\nsarily informal. \nYou will find this confirmed in the foundations \nof mathematics as understood at present. \nThe far flung enterprise \nof David Hilbert undertaken at the beginning of this ce,1tury, to \nestablish mathematics as a set of 'put>ely formal operations, has \nfailed. \nThere is in mathematics a knowledge that cannot be made \nexplicit; every time a formal deductive\u00b7 system is b,rought to bear \non an interpretation of it, we evoke some of this tacit knowledge \n~. \ncontained in mathematics. It is evoked by attending from the \nformulae of mathematics to something eise that the formulae mean, \nor may mean. \nThis is a process of tacit knovring which as such is continuous \nwith the vray we know our body by living in it. It is a process of \n:\u2022 \ninteriorisation. \n\\-le have seen cases before where explicit rules of \ninference were useless, unless interiorised. \nRight seeing throug)1 \u00b7 \ninverting spectacles which could not be arrived at by applying ex-\nplicit rules, was achieved by a process which tacitly applied these \nrules. \nThe cyclist too, successfully used rules tacitly, which \nwere useless when applied explicitly. \n:Jut ~Te have yet to see the \nactual process by which a formal system can be interiorised. It is \n\n5 \nworth loolring at an example of such a process. \nTake a manual for \ndriving a motorcar and learn it by heart. \nAssuming that you have \nnever seen a motorcar, you will have to identify it and its parts \nfrom the illustrations of.the manual. \nYou can then'1-&i.:!;..:1l.own at \n. .. \u00b7\u00b7 \n~--:.' \n.\u00b7 \nthe wheel and try to carry out the operations prescrilY,\u20ac\\4: ,i!iy the \n, ... \u00b7-:~. \ntext. \nThus you will start learning to drive and eventually estab-\nlish the bearing of the manual on all the objects it indicates and \nthe skills\u00b7\u00b7 it teaches. \nWe can observe here in detail the process of intelligent in-\nteriorisation by which an explicit directive is assimilated and \nmade to function as a guide to a skilful performance, It is \nshifted to the back of the driver's mind, so that he can attend \nfrom it to the road in front of him. \nIf the traffic were slowed \ndown a thousandfold, one could perhaps drive a motorcar by refer-\n, \nring at each move to a manual, but one can guide split second deci-\n--\nsions only by tacitly relying on it. Psychologists have observed \nthat the number of objects to which we can explicitly attend at \none time can hardly be more than ten. \nWe see once more, what I \n' \nhave already mentioned for the case of perceiving an object by \nintegrating its sensory clues, that the richness and speed of tacit \nintegration exceeds by far the powers of explicit adjustment carried \nout at the focus of attention. \nDut again, we must realise that the difference between using \na manual explicitly, which would be impracticable, and using it \nproperly as interiorised at the back of our minds, is a- matter of \ndegree: it is a difference between different depths of interiorisa-\ntion, \nNo rule or conception, however explicitly applied, can have \n\n., \nany sense or use, except by functioning as an extension of our \neyes and ears and muscles. \n6 \nHere is a point which brings to the lips of philcisophers the \nname of Kant. \nHe was the first to declare that exuernaJ..,.,i~xperience \n., \nt..,.';-!\" \n(._r \nis possible only by our participation in the act of kng.:rJ!ig. \nDut \nthe participation Kant postulated as the necessary condition of \nexperience is very different from that which I am envisaging. It \nI \nwas thought'\u00b7. to take place according to strict conceptual categories, \nwhich are necessarily fixed and leave neither need for intelligent \neffort nor scope for personal judgment. \nHence Kantian legislation \nfor experience is both infallible and impersonal, the knowing self \n\u00b7 is the recipient of \\{nowledge over 'which he has no control. \nThis \nis quite different from the process of tacit lcnowing by which we \nestablish a coherence of clues jointly bearing\u00b7on a comprehensive \nentity and anticipate the inexhaustible manifestations of its real-\nity, It is quite different from the process of interiorisation by \nwhich we achieve the capacity for attending from an interiorised \ntheory to the experience on which we are bringing it to bear. These \nparticipations of ours', which acquire dramatic force in the creative \nacts of the mind, are neither automatic nor infallible. \nThey are \n-\nhazardous operations developed by training, the aptitude for which \nvaries from what is native to all men, to such as possessed only by\u00b7 \n, \ngenius. \nDut to see this difference, is to recognise why Kant could not \npossibly accept the views I am putting forward here. \nThe a:.:thor \nof the Critique of r~re Reason had come to rescue scientifi~ reason \nfrom the blight cast upon it by Hume's scepticism and \u2022to gain for \n\n,I \n7 \nourselves 1 (as he wrote) 'a possession \\'lhich can never again be \ncontested, 1 \nHe could not have accepted my recommendation for rely-\ning on our \nlishing an \n, \nawareness of largely unidentifiable clues, for estab-\n. \n\u2022f\\1~-,; \nundefinably harmonious coherence, fraught.Wit;'ti,\u2022t\u00b51limited \n. \n\u00b7- --\n,. \nand perhaps unthinkable implications. \n. \n.-,.-'d\u00b7 \nIt is, in .fact,,::rfu.ti-a posi-\n\u00b7 ... \ntion which readily commends itself to the scientific. mind of our \nculture. \n\\ \nYet, had Kant only looked at his finger through a peep hole in \na sheet of paper and moved the finger about, he would have seen that \nthe transformation of raw sense impressions, which he called \nAnschauung, into the experience of an object, is a matter of degree, \ndepending on the range of clues offered to our eyes. \nimd perhaps \n' . \u00b7\\~ \nhe would have recognised then that the object itself, of which we \n.\u00b7 \nthus get a glimpse, is not a mere unknowable residue, a Ding an \nSich, shorn of all it(!_ sensuous qualities, but something substantia~ \npoint_ing beyond itself to its inexhaustible implications. \n-\nFor in spite of being strictly resolved on firmly establishing \nthe legitimate powers of reason, Kant here and there admitted in-\ncidentally, that into all acts of judgment there enters, and must \nenter, a personal decision vihich cannot be accounted .for by any \nrules. \nKant says that no rules can ever determine exhaustively the \noperations of intelligence, for no system of rules can prescribe /' \nthe procedure by which the rules themselves are to be applied. \nOf \nthis ultimate agency which, unfettered by any explicit rules, de-\ncides on the subsumption of a particular instance under a general \nconcept, Kant says only that it 1is 1\u00b71hat constitutes our so-called \nmother-wit 1. \nIndeed, at another point he declares the faculty neces-\n\n8 \nsary for the exercise of such judgment to be quite inscrutable. He \nsays that the way our inte\u00b7111~ce t4't\"ms and applies the schema of \na class of particulars 1is a skill so deeply hidden in the human \nsoul that \nemploys 1 , \nwe shall hardly guess the secret trick tli'Jt:i-la,iJ.ure here \n. \n\u2022.-\u00b7 ,~:..:::.;, \nWe are told, in effect, that every time we sp'eak of \ndogs, trees or tables in general, or else identify something as a \ndog, a tree or a table, we are performing a secret trick which is \n\\. \nnot likely ever to be revealed to our understanding. \nThe formation of concepts and the subsumption of appropriate \n\u00b7 instances under a concept is in fact essentially a function of \ntacit knowing. \nSince every-member of an empirical set of objects \ndiffers from the other in every particular, the subsumption of such \n' \n-, .. \nobjects under one title cannot be justified by any strictly formal-\nised procedure, and the way in which it is nonetheless reliably \ncarried out has long been a problem of philosophy. \nThe solution \n~ \nlies in recognising the powers of tacit knowing to present us with \nthe joint meaning of an aggregate of disparate particulars. \nThis resolves the ancient problem, what a man is like to whom \n\u2022 \nthe concept of \n1man 1 applies. \nHow can he be both fair and dark, \nboth young and old, brown, black and yellow at the se,me time? \nOr \nif he is neither of these, how can he be a man without any of the \np!'operties of a man? \nThe answer is that in speaking of man in \ngeneral we are not attending to any particular man, but are relying \non our tacit awareness of individual men, for attending to their \nj0int meaning. \nThis meaning is a comprehensive entity. \u00b7rts knowl-\nec.ge is wiped out by attending to its particulars in themselves and \nhence the concept of man cannot be identified with any mere aggregate \n.men, past or future. \n\n9 \nA class of natural objects, like dogs or men, is real, for \nthe things that hang together in terms of such a class, may be ex-\npected to hang together also in other altogether inexhaustible ways. \n\u2022 \n. \n, _,t,\u00b7-,,. \nThis fact has always been clear, but it mistakenly'appea.t].ed inex-\n-\n. -... . \nt-:;'_\u2022, i., \n,\u00b7 \nplicable, because it could not be accounted for by any:?-t!l:::,J'.i.icit \nmental operations. \nKant rightly regarded, therefore, its under-\nstanding to lie beyond the powers of his system. \nModer~'philosophers regard conceptions, as nominalists have \ndone since Abelard, as mere collections of objects designated by \na common name and they would overcome the difficulty that such a \nname would designate an indefinite variety of disparate objects, \nby ascribing an 'open texture' to the\u00b7conception going by such a \n' . \u00b7\\~ \nname. \nDut this begs the question, how a designation can be applied \nwith such openness as is required for covering:a11 the disparate \nmembers of a natural ~lass and yet be able reliably to exclude \nothers that are not its members. \nThe conception of natural classes \ncannot be understood without acl<nowledging the powers of tacit know-\ning. \n' \nFor centuries past the systematic thinking of modern man has \nbeen based almost invariably on the. assumption that a process of \ninference must be explicit. \nDut there have been important thinkers, \nsince the last eighty years or so, who have anticipated parts of . \n. , \nt'.::e position I am trying to establish here ar..d to me their work \nRecms clearly to point in the direction which I am following here. \nAbout the turn of the last century, German thinkers postulated \nthat indwelling is the proper means of knowing man and the humani-\nties. \nDilthey taught that the mind of a person can be understood \n\n10 \nonly by reliving its workings and Lipps represented aesthetic appre-\nciations as our entering into a work 6f art and thus dwelling in \nthe mind of its creator. \nDilthey and Lipps were right in saying \nthat such knowledge can be achieved only by indwerl.-1ng. \nDut my \n\u00b7\u00b7~ :~ .. ,-,y- ~~4?.\u2022 ' ', \nanalysis of tacit knowing shows that they\u00b7were mistaJi:en~1n affirm-\n. \n,:~\\\u00bd~1.~ \ning that this fact sharply distinguishes the humanities from the \nnatural sciences. \nThere is a continuous transition from indwelling \nin science, to the fuller participation of the knower in the study \nof literature and history. \nMy conception of indwelling is more deeply affiliated to \nexistentialism and to Husserl's phenomenology. \nI am aiming, as \nHusserl did, at rescuing the reality of an essentially hierarchic \nuniverse from being flattened out by\u00b7a Laplacean analysis of the \nworld. \nDut I shall not try to unfold -the true structure of things, \nas Husserl tried, by excluding the question of their reality. \nHus-\n--\nserl ta.lrns over from .:Jrentano the intentionality of knowledge and \nenters thereby into lived experience. \nFor him, intentionality \ncreates the conditions for the objectivity of such experience. \nHe \nthought, until the last part of his life, that, by excluding its \nbearing on reality, the analysis of such lived structures becomes \nunerring, transcendental. \nDut when this dream dissolved, as he \nconfessed, such structural analysis was reduced to subjectivity._ \nI' \nI shall show how my theory of knowledge tries, on the contrary,' to \ndiscipline intentionality by its bearing on reality. \nHusserl has proved so far the most influential th~nker of the \ntwentieth century. \nAs it became clear that knowledge of lived \nexperience, which he was seeking, was knowledge possessed by indwell-\n\n11 \ning, it transpired that it was a knowledge of being. \nSo we arrive \nat Heidegger and French existentialism. \nFrom the theory of tacit knowing we can derive\u00b7,,the being-in-\n. \n: .. -,y--i~f\\' '., \n. \n. ~ \n--\nthe -Vlorld, the Dasein of man, as defined by Heidegger. \u2022~uFoi(' every \n'\u00b7:. \u20221: ........ 1 \nmeaningful thought and action of ours interiorises particulars for \nthe purpose of attending to their joint significance)and thus we \npopulate the known world with comprehensive entities the elements \nof which function logically as parts of ourselves. \nOur being \nextends then over the range of our understanding. \nWe have here \nHeidegger's Field of Deing (as William Darrett has called it) and \nwe discover its logical theory: \nwhich is that every act of compre-\n-,. \nhension shapes jointly our existence and our knowledge. \nOnce interiorisation is accepted as intrinsic\u2022to knowing, an \nanalysis of knowledge will keep bringing up various aspects of \n...._ \nexistence, and such observations will confirm the results of \nexistentialist philosophy. \nDut they will go beyond existentialism \nby revealing the logical structure of the observed existential \ncommitments. \nYet the existential elements-of human knowledge have a dif-\nferent quality from the existential elements of human destiny. \nMan's life and fate evoke a more intense and immediate interest \n_,, \nthan does man's knowledge of things. \nThis may partly account for \nthe difference between the perspectives into which being is fitted \nby the two enquiries. \nHeidegger brings out man's being-in-the-\nworld by confronting him with death which cancels his projects. To \nme, man's striving for truer being and knowledge appears justified \nwithin a cosmic process of organic evolution leading on to responsi-\n\nble manhood in a society of explorers, \nYet a fundamental problem of existentialism, as formulated by \nSartre, will be with us all the time, \nThroughout this enquiry I \nshall seek to answer the question on what grounds ~iJ''-~po,ssibly \n. ., \n....,... \n,. \njustify a choice of existence; \nThis puzzling query will be seen to be linked to the problem \nof discovery, \nFor discovery presents us with a kindred paradox, \n\\ \nwhich has long been neglected, \nWe shall approach it by asking our-\nselves once more: \nwhat is a problem? \nIt is a commonplace that all research must start from a problem. \nDut how can one see a problem? \nFor to see a problem is to see some-\nthing that is hidden, It is to have an intimation of the coherence \nof hitherto not comprehended particulars. \nTo see a problem that \nwill lead to a great discovery is not only to anticipate something \nhidden, but to see something of which the rest of humanity cannot \n-~ \nhave an inkling. \nAll this is commonplace; we take it for granted, \nwithout noticing the clash of self-contradiction entailed in it, \nYet Plato has'pointed out this contradiction in the Meno. \nHe says \n. \nthat to search for the solution of a problem is an absurdity; for \neither you know what you are looking for, and then there is no \nproblem; or you do not know what you are looking for, and then you \nare not looking for anything and cannot expect to find anything. \n,-\u00b7 \nThe solution which Plato offered for this paradox was that all \ndiscovery is a remembering of past lives. \nThis explanation has \nhardly ever been accepted, but neither has any other solution been \noffered for avoiding the contradiction. \nSo we are faced with the \nfact that for two thousand years and more, humanity has progressed \n\n13 \nby the efforts of people solving difficult problems, while all the \ntime it could be shown that to do this was either meaningless or \nimpossible. \nFor the Meno is essentially right. It points to the \n\u00b7t ~\\{~.; ~ \n.. ~:, \nfac,.t that so long as we think of knowledge. as having a,.:-'cleterminate \n: };ttj}:' \ncontent, the conception of a problem is self-contradictory and the \n.. \nachievement of discovery is incomprehensible. \nFor discovery is an \nact of tacit knowing, guided by an anticipation of its achievement \u2022 \n. ,, \nWhenever we come to understand something, we must pass a stage \nwhen we have partly understood it. \nWhen things are understood at \na glance, as when we recognise familiar objects in a well lit room, \nwe shall not be able to catch an imperfect stage of understanding. \nDut think of long-dravm efforts to see things through inverting \nspectacles. \nAny incomplete stage of such an exertion must be filled \nwith a striving towards its completion, even though this will re-\nquire the invention,of a novel way of seeing, never experienced \nbefore. \nA problem is then the partial comprehension of a coherence, \nstriving for its co~summation. \nAn intellectual appetite responds \nhere, like all appetites, to a potential increment of its own satis-\nfaction. \nThe pursuit of a proJ:>lein feels its way towards discovery, \nby sensing the growing proximity of discovery. \nThe two terms of tacit knowing are radially aligned so that> \nthe knower projects himself along this line into that which he knows. \nThe pursuit of discovery extends this projection over a sequence \nof stages, each successive stage being achieved by an act of tacit \nknowing based on the stage that preceded it. Thus the vectorial \ncharacter of tacit knowing is intensified into a sustained drive \n\n14 \non the trail to discovery. \nFrom our experience of the way tacit knowing is achieved in \nmaking out what we see or in trying to feel our way with a stick, \nwe may expect such an effort to \n1) The effort will consist \nhave the following 'd!iaT<;t~,t\",ristics. \n. \n. .. \n~:.:\u00b7i, \nin trying to attend fro~c~f'. set of \n\u00b7 .. .,. . \nproximal particulars to their unl<nown joint meaning. \nThese particu-\nlars are interiorised and not attended to in themselves; they may \n\\ '\u00b7 \nindeed be subliminal. \nThey usually cannot be fully specified and \nsometimes not even approximately identified. \n2) The relation by which they will be integrated into a com-\nprehensive entity will be physiognomic or skilful and hence vir-\ntually undefinable. \n- , \n3) When eventually integrated to such an entity, their appear-\nance will assume a new quality, never experienced before. \nGreat discoveries will tend to show a high degree of indeter-\n-.._ \nminacy in all three respects: \nin the choice of data, in the mode \n-\nof their integration and the novel quality of the result. \nRemember \nthe origins of relativity in the puzzling question whether a moving \nlight source could overtal<e \na beam emitted by it. \nSuch a problem \nis wide open; Einstein has described the decade during which it was \ngestated. \n\"During all these years\" he wrote, \"there was a feeling \nof direction, of going straight towards something concrete. It 1~_-, \nof course, very hard to express that feeling in words; but it was \ndecidedly the case, and clearly to be distinguished from later con-\nsiderations about the rational forms of the solution. 11 \nThis long \ndrive towards something concrete which had yet no rational form, \nwas a tacit effort to achieve coherence, and its result was a \n\n15 \ncomprehensive conceptual innovation, transforming the appearance \nof the world. \nThe creation of a new inter:r;:,retative framework transforms the \nmind of him who achieves it. Only a new forcible interiorisation \nof elementary features can bring about such a rebirt1ii.:.:::01' .. ,our intel\u2022-\n., \nt,;;\"~ i :' \nlectual selves. \nThe problem which has led to such a re:~{ must \n. ;~ \nhave anticipated an existential change. \nRelativity not only changed \nour interpretative framework, but also contributed to a shift in \nour standa;ds of intellectual valuation towards an appreciation or \nmore abstractly mathematical harmonies. \nDiscovery must the:r'efore \nhave been striving to\u00b7wards new kinds of intellectual beauty, more \nsatisfying to our transformed intellectual selves. \nWe have here the characteristic features of supreme original-\nity. \nA new comprehensive coherence is achieved, having a -novel \nappearance and mal,ing us see the world i\n0\nn a new way'.\u2022 \nIt involves \na change of ourselves by making us interiorise a new interpretative \n-\nframework and adopt novel standards of intellectual excellence.\u00b7 \nSuch deliberate self transformation may raise the question on \nwhat grounds we can possibly justify such a change of our identity. \nCould it be that man can in fact choose his own values, as Sartre \nand before him Nietzsche ,~ould have. him do? \nWe are brought up here sharply against the full significance \nof the dilemma with which I presented you in recommending a path ,~ ' \nto discovery starting from the unexamined acceptance of unspecifi-\nable grounds and aiming at a result distinguished by its vague and \ninexhaustible implications, \nAll that I have said since then about \nthe foreknowledge that would guide us along such\u00b7a path and of the \n\n16 \nself transformation involved in any major success of it, only adds \nto the questionable character of such an enterprise. \nI accept the charge, but for the moment I shall counter it \nonly by saying with Kierl<egaard, \"Either Or\"--look \ntive. \" \nThere are ways of advancing knowledge without navigating over \nseas of fantastic indeterminacies. \nSome problems can be solved by \n' \nmerely surveying all possible solutions. \nExistentially, surveying \nis the opposite extreme to the creative solving of major problems. \nTo map out a country by triangulation, to extend the geography of \nthe heavens by photography, or to follow through a series of sys-\ntematic variations in the conditi.ons of. an experiment, is an ex-\n\u00b7\u2022.~ \nplicitly prescribed mode of extending kno~ledge. It requires a \nminimum of indwelling, and thus approaches as closely as possible, \nthe ideal of scientific detachment. It does not involve us per-\nsonally, as the moulding of our minds into the comprehension of a \nhidden meaning. \nIn fact, it presents no problems to torment us, \nevokes no hunches to excite us, offers no triumphs and causes no \nsurprises. \nDut consequently, it is dull, it is soul killing: \ndetestable to minds gifted for creative tasks. \nAnd it is sterile. \nSo let us return, after all, to the pursuit of discovery with all \nits vagaries. \nA good problem is an anticipation of a hidden truth and its \nclues represent an aspect of the future discovery to be made by \nsolving the problem; to recognise a problem is to discern.an aspect \nof a hidden truth, not visible to others, less sensitive to the \ntell-tale traces of a pattern in nature. \nYet, often when I lecture \n\n17 \non the precious knowledge contained in a good problem, and of the \nspecial gifts needed to recognise a good problem, my audience would \nsuggest that problems consist simply in observing something that \nseems to contradict the hitherto accepted laws of nature. \nThis is \n. \n\u00b7t\\:;:~\u00b7-,, \n-\na far\". too narrow view of wh.at constitutes a problem; ~-;nre,)-ejko it \n--\"u:,r-\nbegs the question which it disposes of. \nFor to recognise~ a good \nproblem in an apparent deviation from the currently accepted laws \nof nature, .is to judge, and rightly judge, that the deviation is \n'\u00b7 \nreal and that it is also important and likely to be capable of \nelucidation. \nSuch judgments require the very kind of scientific \ninsight which I have said to be necessary for recognisii1g any good \nproblem. \nTake the case of extra sensory perception. \nSome scientists \nregard these observations as pointing to an important problem, while \nothers prefer to set the evidence aside, believing that there is \nnothing in it. The questio~ possibly one of greatest importance, \nremains open. \nSimilar questions face the working scientist. time \nand again. \nInexpJ.icable things keep turning up in a laboratory \nand are brushed aside ~s dirt-effects. \nOne risks thus to ignore \nimportant clues. \nDequerel discovered radioactivity and Rontgen \ndiscovered X-rays by inquiring ipto\u00b7the fogging of photographic \nplates which they might have set aside as insignificant accidents. \nDut to enquire ir.to every inexplicable observation ,,ould be to \nundertake a succession of wild goose chases. \nScientists must un-\nceasingly discri:ninate betweE:n significant facts which may present \na problem and accj_dental events not fj_t for investiga'.;ion. \nA wrong \nchoice may be fateful.while an exceptionally good choice may prove \n\n18 \na mark of genius. \nWe must realise also, that for a working scientist to accept \na problem as his subject, means to engage in an enterprise. \nAll \nthe conditions of this enterprise must be assessed-,b~..):\u00b5,Jll. \nIt is \n., \n~:-~ : \u00b7-' \nnot 'enough that his problem should point to a potentia~.;.discovery \u2022 \n. \u00b7 '.\u00b7 \nIt had been known for a long time that in the periodic system the \nsequence of two pairs of elements was inverted. \nThis was eventually \n' \nexplained by Moseley's discovery of atomic numbers equal to the \ncharge of the nucleus. \nDut any enquiry into this question before \nMoseley's study of X-ray spectra would have been a waste of time. \nA problem is good only if it is ripe. \nIt must be feasible; and this \u00b7means, feasi.ble by the scientist \n. . \u00b7\\~ \nwho considers to undertake its pursuit.. He must be able to assess \nhis 011n powers, his special gifts and resources as a means i'or \nsolving the problem. \nHe must assess also whether the chances of \ndiscovery and the importance of a prospective discovery are such \nas to justify the investment of his powers. \nA lesser use or them \nwould be almost as wasteful as their application to a problem which \nwill prove insoluble,' Most working scientists can bitterly remem-\nber suffering both kinds of waste; \nThese requirements may appear extravagant. \nTo assess jointly \nthe prospects of all the clues 1-rhich point to a problem, its soun,s:1..: \nness and ripeness, its feasibility in view of the scientist's \nspecial faculties and resources, and its importance compared with \nany alternative use of these faculties, may seem to be beyond the \npower of any mind. \nThey are, of course, far beyond the power of \nany explicit evaluation. \nThe number of objects to which we can ex-\n\n19 \nplicitly attend, even though only to estimate their number, will \nin the simplest experimental conditions be hardly more than ten. \nDut the variety and number of items that can be tacitly integrated \nto a decision is vast. \nRemember, once more, the split~-~econd deci-\n.\u00b7.:~\u00b7- - \u00b7r~l \nI J \nsions' of a skilful driver, compared with someone \ncar by referring to a detailed prescription. \nOr \ntryin$,tl.to:\u00b7drive a \n. \u00b7\u00b7: ''.i-,.. ~ \nthink of the num-\nberless clues combined at every moment in watching an object moving \nabout in front of us. It is by his powers of tacit integration that \nthe scientist can swiftly combine and appraise the many disparate \nclues and resources which might contribute to his enquiry. \nSuch acts of tacit integration that are vital both to the in-\nception and conduct of scientif:Lc \u00b7enquiry, ar& obliterated by \nachieving success. \nOnce solved, a problem can never puzzle us \nagain. \nSteps which required exceptional penetration and imagina-\ntive powers, may well appear obvious. \nLooking back today on the \nyear 1923 when de Droglie put forward the wave theory of' matter, it \nwould seem obvious that it would be tested by looking f'or the dif'-\nf'raction of electron beams by crystals in analogy to the diff'raction \nof X-rays. \nIm element'ary computation would have shown that beams \nof right wave length could easily be obtained. \nYet I have told you \nhow astounded we were, when two years after de Droglie 1s theory was \npublished, Elsasser first suggested such a possibility. \nWhen, even-\n,,. \ntually, another two years later Davison and Germer in America and \nG. P. Thomson in England actually produced such dif'f'raction patterns, \nthis was still regarded as a feat of' sufficient originality, to \nsecure the Nobel prize to its authors. \nIntellectual passions, like bodily passions, are abated by \n\n20 \ntheir satisfaction. It needs the art of a novelist, like Arthur \nKoestler, to revive in our imagination the years of Kepler's strug-\ngle with the wanderings of the planet Mars, which would accord with \nno reasonable \nThe fact \ncombination of steady circular motions-,>-\u00b7\u2022 \n\u00b7-:.~:,-~-t-~~~~ :.' \nthat a completed act of tacit knowing ob~;h~~f_a.tes its \nantecedents assists those current theories of discovery w_hich would \nignore tacit powers of the mind or set them aside as none of their \nbusiness. \nThe corresponding tendency to explain discovery, as far \nas possible, by explicit operations was systematically misleading. \nThe scientist straining his tacit powers in pursuit of discovery, \nis immersed in what he does. \nThe interiorisation of clues, the \ngroping for intellectual harmonies,\" the passionate anticipation of \na still hidde\u00b7n truth of which these harmonies are the tokens, in-\nvolve his whole person. \nA theory that ignores the mechanism of \ntacit knowing must ignore or deny these commitments. \nThe scientist's commitments\u00b7 are minimised also by giving a \nfalse impression of the fact, that he is prepared to abandon any \nparticular hunch, if it proved false. \nThe tentativeness of his \nevery step is taken to' show that he is uncommitted. \nDut in an im-\nportant sense every step taken in tJ:ie conduct of research is defini-\ntive, for it definitely disposes of the time, the effort and the \nresources used up in making it. This is no small matter, for these -\n.<' \ninvestments add up with frightening rapidity to the whole profes--\nsional life of those engaged in research, and i1ill exhaust even \nbefore this the credit of a scientist responsible for conducting \nscientific enquiries. \nTo thin\\{ of scientific workers cheerfully \ntrying this and trying that, calmly changing course at each failure, \n\n21 \nis totally misleading. \nThe researcher's position is more like that \nof the chess player, who has only a short time for making his next \nirrevocable move. \nThis applies to all kinds o.f moves: \nto the adQP:!;ion of a prob-\n\u00b7-:- \u00b7:\u00b7~<J\"\" -~.-... :, \n... \u00b7, \n~ \n:.r \nlem, the acceptance of a hypothesis for testing it and to\u00b7t;he claims \n, ~~\\H,..:. i ~ \nmade for the final result in publishing it. It is wideiyadmitted \ntoday that hypotheses arise by intuition. \nDut we must consider that \n' \nunless a hypothesis has a fair chance of proving true, or at least \npartly true, it is useless. \nUnless the ideas which a scientist will \nundertake to test have a chance of at least one in ten to succeed, \nhe would waste more than nine months out of ten in fruitless test-\ning. \nHe would not last long in his, profession. \nConsidering the \n\u00b7,. \nnumber of conceivable ideas that might be suggested at each stage, \na faculty which can produce a valid surmise at least in one try out \nof ten, must be credited with the power of discovery, \nTo describe \nthis power as\u00b7intuition, and set it aside as such, is to set aside \nwhat is essential to discovery at all stages. \nFor at every step \nthe same powers of tacit knowing carry on the deepening of our in-\nsight, which eventually results in discovery. \nA scientist's claim to a discovery is a personal commitment \nand in accepting his claim, the scientific community shares and the \nlay public shares too, at second hand, this commitment. \nnecent \n,. \nliterature has tried to make the justification of such a commitment \neasier, by saying that science does not claim certainty for its \nresults and puts them forward only as probable. \nDut thinl< of the \nway you can wipe out all oppositic~ if in an argument you can \ndeclare, tha.t something has been proved by science. \nWe have as \n\n22 \nmuch confidence in the laws of nature as affirmed by science, as we \nhave in any human utterance. If this is not certainty, then there \nis no such thing, and the word is meaningless. \nIn any case, the \nquestion, on what grounds we accord such great confHlep.c;_e, as we \n... \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7*\u2022' \n.. \n~ .. :..:: \n, , \ndo, to the teachings of science remains the same, wheth~f:t~is \n\u2022 \u00b7, '! :-.,,. ~ \nconfidence attributes certainty or probability to science; \nTo minimise the claims of science in order to reduce the prob-\nlem of our acceptance of science, we are told also that science is \nmerely tentative, always ready to move on to a new position, if \nchallenged by new evidence. \nDut this again is beside the point. \nHowever ready we are to move on, we shall always be at some place \nat any particular moment. \nExistential-ism and the modern theory of \nchoice have both taught us to acknowledge that the choice to do \nnothing, or to go on trying, is as irrevocable as a decision to \nact. \nDeclarations to accept the theories of science only tentative-\nly, are, in fact, merely verbal. \nThey attempt to avoid our actual \ncommitment, by a fiction which, were it\u00b7true, would be irrelevant. \nThe fact remains, that we grant our confidence to the theories \nof science without any'formal proof of its Justification. \n\\'Je com-\nmit ourselves in the light of our p~rsonal judgment. \nLet me sum up in preparation for my final argument. \nFrom the \nmoment when the scientists first surmised that there was something -\nthere that was puzzling; through the stage where he fixed on this \nas a definite problem; through the pursuit of successive hunches \nthat arose from this problem; to the dawning of discovery and the \npublic affirmation of its claims; we have seen the same urge of \ncomprehension seeking to exercise its powers and groping for the \n\n23 \ndirection in which they are increasingly satisfied, but still \nleaving open, when crowned by a discovery, a degree of incomplete-\nness which is accepted as a token of yet unseen implications,to be \n\u2022!y~.:~-~,-~:,i \n.. \nt,;:'.\":: :.'' \nrevealed one day to others, who will follow after. \n.r12:~-}t \nThe predominance of our tacit faculties in shapirig:ehe course \nof discovery and stamping its conclusion with our personal satis-\nfaction is now clearly established. \nDut does this achievement not \n' '\u00b7, \nopen at our feet once more the abyss of self-doubt, in the very \nterms in which I opened this lecture? \nWe seem to be left up in the \nair, with nothing to keep us up there, except a firm hold on our \nown boot straps. \nHowever, I should hope that scienc;e itself might provide us \nwith a more substantial principle of levitation. \n'.rhere is an as-\npect of our self reliance in the pursuit of science, which we yet \nhave to bring fully tQ bear on our situation. \nA scientist's ori-\nginality lies in seeing a problem where others see none and finding \na way to its pursuit, where others lose their bearings. \nThese acts \nof his mind are strictly personal in the sense that they are attri-\nbutable to him and only to him. \nDut they derive their power and \nreceive their guidance from an aim that is strictly impersonal. For \nhis quest pre-supposes the existence of an external reality. \nRe-\nsearch is conducted in these terms from the start and continues td' \ngrope for a hidden truth towards which our clues are pointing; and \nthe discovery which terminates the pursuit and satisfies its author, \nis still sustained by a vision of reality pointing beyond it. \nThis is why even the most original ideas of a scientist en-\ngaged in research, still stand under an impersonal discipline. \nHe \n\n24 \ncan put forward a scientific problem only in the conviction that \nthere is something there to be discovered, something real over which \nhe has no control, and this fills him with a compelling sense of \nresponsibility for the pursuit o:J: a hidden truth, wh:J.ch demands his \n' ~-:.-:c:r \u00b7~\u00b7~~\u00b7 '. \nservices for revealing it. He exercises a personal ju~_fyft only \nin adducing evidence of an external reality. \nHence, however ori-\nginal may be a scientist's way of conducting his research, however \npassionate \u00b7~nd solitary his vision, there is no trace in these of \nself-indulgence. \nThe satisfaction of originality lies in the in-\ntensely personal character of a triumphantly universal result. \nThere is, admittedly, great personal satisfaction to be found \nin successful scientific research \u2022. D~t such pleasure is legitimate \nonly if it is derived from a valid purii'uit of discovery: \nsubjective \nsatisfaction can never be the proper aim.of originality. It seems \nwrong, therefore, to describe the personal element in scientific \noriginality, as subjective. \nA problem, a clue, a hunch, a dis-. \ncovery--they all contain an element that is personal; the whole \nheuristic process is personal, yet its significance is not subjec-\ntive, for it consists in anticipating some part of the truth yet \nto be discovered, which when discoyered will point beyond itself \nto reality. \nTo meet this situation, I have coined the term Personal I<nowl- -\n,, \nedge. \nI have described as tacit knowing the less intensely personal \nform of indwelling, the most striking feature of which lay in its \nunspecifiability. \nTJy passing on to scientific enquiry and to dis-\n. \ncoveries of great originality, we meet with a more dynamic !mowing \nto which the distinctive powers of the knm\u00b7rer make a decisive con-\n\n25 \ntribution. \nHere the term \"personal knowledge\" becomes more appro-\npriate. \nAll tacit knowing is an indwelling which mentally extends the \n\u00b7! \\:;~ -, .\u2022 \nknow~r, enlarges his existence and raises hi_s sense\u00b7 g::r-\u00b7~tional \nbeing; but only in its major enterprises does this expJrtiibn become \nfervid. \nHere we see scientists not merely puzzled, but 'obsessed \nby a problem; here are hunches which grip his mind suddenly with \n-.. \nviolent hopes; where discovery comes. as a triumph to its,author \nand a dazzling surprise to his audience. \nThese emotions are part \nof our having problems and hunches, and making discoveries. \nThey \naccount for the dynamic powers by which problems are grasped and \npursued, hunches are hit upon and deveJoped, discoveries are sighted \n.\u2022 \n' \nand established. \nJ\\11 major enquiry must be motivated throughout \nby these heuristic passions and be guided at every step by seel{ing \nto satisfy them. \n~ \nThese passions differ from those stirred up by our bodily \nneeds. \nThey are generous desires which do not deprive others in \nany share of that whi~h gre.tifies them, but spread widely what they \nenjoy, by the very act of enjoying it. \nThey teach their own pleas-\nures and perpetuate themselves by their own fulfilment. \nMan in \n' \n. \nthought strives to give life to thought. \nHis anticipation of pos-\nsible ideas urges him to force his way into them and thus come tc;>t' \nparticipate in a deeper coherence never yet entered before. \nHighest originality is manifested in the capacity to transform \none 1s own outlook on the world, \n\\\u00b7le may create new standards of \nbeauty by serving them. \nThis is how a choice of existence takes \nplace in science, as it does elsewhere too. \nThe existentialist \n\n26 \ndilemma, how values created at our command can bind us, does not \narise, \nAdmittedly, explicit determination cannot create new stand-\nards. \nIf you regard a choice of' values as you would of a choice of \na menu, you cannot expect to find that these valuei1'hav.~,,authority \n.. \n. \n..,\u00b7, \n~~ i:.' \nover\u00b7 you. \nDut originality is no explicit choice. \nOri~4~a'.:lity, \n. ' \nwhich alone can establish new values, accepts their authority in \nthe very act of creating them, \n\\ \nSince '\u00b7a scientist may put forward his conclusions only if he \ntrusts that they arise from a true understanding of experience in \nits bearing on reality, he holds that others, equipped as he is, \nmust reach the same conclusion. \nSuch is the universal intent of a \nscientific discovery. \nHaving relied :throughout his enquiry on the \npresence of something hidden out there, the scientist must continue \nto rely on that external presence for the validity ~f the result \nthat satisfies his quest, \nAs he has accepted throughout the dis-\ncipline which this external pole of his heuristic endeavour imposed \nupon him, he cannot but expect that others will recognise likewise \nthe impersonal authority that guided him. \nOn the grounds of the \n' \nself discipline which bound him to objectivity, he must claim that \nhis results are universally valid;. \nHe knows not whether his claims will be accepted; they may be \ntrue and yet fail to carry conviction, \nHe may even know that this \n_,. \nis likely to happen. \nNor does eventual acceptance guarantee truth, \nTo claim universal validity for a statement says merely that it \nought to be accepted by all. \nThe affirmation of scientific truth \nhas an obligatory character which it shares with other valuations \ndeemed to be universal, \n\n27 \nDoth the anticipation of discovery and discovery itself, may \nturn out to be a delusion. \nDut it is futile to seek for strictly \nimpersonal criteria of their validity, as philosophies of science \nhave been trying to do. \nTo accept the pursuit of science as a \n. \n\u00b7l )~~-:;;; .:;-,.:,,~4 \nreasonable, successful, enterprise is to share the ki-nd 'of\u2022 \u00b7commit-\n. -t~-tt ~ t ;\u00b7 \nment on which scientists enter by undertaking this entei~prise. \nYou \ncannot formalise the act of commitment, for you cannot express your \ncommitment ~on-commitally. \nTo attempt this is to exercise the kind \nof lucidity which destroys its subject matter, \nWe should be glad to recognise instead that science has come \ninto existence by powers of anticipation akin to those on which all \nhopes for truth and beauty are grounded, and that science rests \n' \n.. \n~ \nultimately on such intangible powers of' the mind. \nIf this.leaves \nscience up in the air, it will keep us c9mpany there.

    "content_html": "<p>The Emergence of Man by Michael Polanyi (lis delivered on March 2, 1964 at Duke University) At the end of my first lecture I said that the C9P,ei;-nican &#x27;. ~-.. _.\u2022-&#x27;1&quot;&quot;&#x27; ~-~ revolut-ion, completed by Newton, has placed on\u00b7 the same/ 1fJe,1,: the . &#x27;:&#x27;;~--H\u00b7 ultimate components of all things, including those of mari\u2022and of . &#x27; the thoughts of man. Ever&lt;Jthing in the world would be explicable then by the laws governing these uniform ultimate components. No additional higher principle would be at work in them; there would, in fact, be only one level of existence in the world. Dut I opposed this world view and promised that once we credit ourselves with genuine pouers of integration., we shall see the structure or our comprehens\u00b7ion re-appear in the structure of that which we com- prehend. We shall be able to uphold the existence of genuinely . &#x27; higher entities, not altogether determined by the laws to which their ultimate components are subject. * I have shown how we participate in the world by understanding it. We know all the complex things we see around us, whether inani- mate or living, dumb or intelligent, by relying on our awareness of their parts for attending to them as wholes, and this process is logically equivalent to using their parts as we use our own body for attending to things outside it. Thus we form an interpreted __.,. universe populated by entities, the particulars of which we have interiorised for the sake of comprehending their meaning in the shape of coherent entities. Consider now the situation when two nersons share the l&lt;nowledge -- . of the same comprehensive entity--of an entity which one of them y</p>\n<p>2 produces and the other apprehends, Such is the case when one person has made a communication and the other has received it. Dut the characteristic features of the situation are seen more clearly if we consider the way one man gets to understand a skilful per- formance of another man. He must try mentally to com-h:1-&#x27;n~.,,the move- . w., !.,.:;~: ; _ r ments, of the performer to the same pattern to ~rhich the !-ioetformer .. -: .... -~ . combines them practically, Two kinds of indwelling meet here. The performer coordinates his moves by dwelling in them as parts of his body, while \u00b7the person who watches him tries to correlate these moves by seeking to dwell in them from outside. He dwells in these moves by interiorising them. Dy such exploratory ind,\u2022relling the pupil gets the feel of a master&#x27;s skill and may learn to rival him. Nor is this structural kinship&#x27;between subject and object, and the indwelling of one in the other, present only in the study of a bodily performance. Chess players enter into a master&#x27;s spirit by rehearsing the games he played, to discover what he had in mind. When entering and dwelling in comprehensive entities of this kind, we meet something that accounts for the coherence of the entity. In one case we meet a person skilfully using his body and, &#x27; in the other, a person cleverly using his mind. The recognition of a person in the performance of a skill or in the conduct of a game of chess is intrinsic to the understanding of these achievements, We must surmise that we are faced with some coordinated performance, before we can even try to understand it, and must go on to pick out the features that are essential to the performance, with a view to the action felt to be at work in it. Hence, the question, much discussed by philosophers, how we</p>\n<p>3 can infer--explicitly infer--the existence of other minds, from observing their external worl,ings, does not arise, for we never do observe these worl&lt;ings in themselves. Indeed, many of them we could not identify, even after \\&#x27;le have successfully integrated them to . ., \u00b7.,.:)\u00b7-.. our knowledge of a personal performance, any more tha\u00b7n\u00b7:Jt&#x27;!3&quot;.,&#x27;,PE,rformer - -.: \u2022.: \u2022 I .. &#x27;.. i j, could tell us, except quite vaguely, what the particulars-:!la..re that his performance coordinates, This is.not to say that we gain an understanding of the mind \u2022\u00b7. without a process of enquiry. Dut the enquiry consists, like a scientific enquiry, in picking out clues as such, that is, with a presumed bearing on the presence of something they appear to indi- cate. And as in a scientific enquiry, many of the clues used will remain unidentifiable and may indeed be~ subliminal, Such is the &quot; effort by which we enter into the intimate structure of a skill or of a game of chess and get to know the powers of the person behind it. The method by whicJ:l a historian explores a historic personality, is an expansion of this way of knowing. The structural kinnhip. between knowing a mind and pursuing a scientific enquiry throws light on some further points obscured by the false assumption that we start acquiring the knowledge of a mind by observing the workings of the mind in themselves. It tells us that the mind is unsubstantial only in the sense in which a good problem is unsubstantial, Indeed, a great mind is an inexhaustible~ . , and rewarding problem to the historian and literary scholar, and every human person is of infinite concern to one who cares for him. Dut neither problems nor minds should on this account be set far apart from other things, For an inanimate solid object, too, is</p>\n<p>4 known by understanding its particulars, from which we attend to it as an object, This brings up a question similar to that I have just spoken of in respect of our knowledge of other minds, The question is \u00b7l f~-:.;-t-:,.-,:,a now ho}&#x27;I&#x27; we infer the existence of a permanent. object, \u00b7fronf&#x27; observ- ing its sensible qualities. ,};tt~}~- Anal~rtic philosophers would dispose of this problem by denying that we ever see anything but objects. Ilut this is not true. We do see the several parts of a camouflaged \u00b7\u00b7\u2022 object as mere patches, and can break down this deception then by an effort to see these fragments meaningfully as an object. These philosophers are right in pointing out that no process of explicit inference takes place either in getting to know a mind, or in see- ing a cobblestone, and that it is fruitless, therefore, to enquire in the way such an inference is conducted; they overlook the fact that we do get to !{now solid objects only by a tacit integration of their parts, l&#x27;lhich may require a difficult intellectual effort. The examples which I have quoted point at a new aspect of this ., problem of philosophy. The structural kinship between knowing a person and discovering \u00a71, problem, and the alignment of both with our knowing of a cobblestone, call attention to the greater depth of a person and a problem, as compared with the lesser profundity of a cobblestone. Persons and problems are felt to be more pro- found, because we expect them to reveal themselves more richly and/ unexpectedly in the future. Since I have attributed the capacity of things to reveal themselves inexhaustibly in the future, to the fact that they are an aspect of reality, I shall say that minds and problems possess a d9eper reality than cobblestones, even though</p>\n<p>5 cobblestones are more tangible, And since the significance of a thing is more important than its tangibility, I shall say that minds and problems are more real than cobblestones. With this settled, we can say now also that manfii.:s~J,Jful ., !,....!&quot;~ . &#x27; , exercise of his body is a real entity that another pers9n,r~in !mow, and know only, by comprehending it, and that the comprehension of this real entity has the same structure as the entity which is its \\. object. And \u00b7\u00b7we may likewise say--to drive the point home--that the skilful conduct of a game of chess by another person is a real entity, knowable by our tacit comprehension of it, and that this comprehension is similar in structure to that which it comprehends. You may feel that I have been\u00b7s1ow in drawing this conclusion. Dut I had to make quite sure of it, for it carries far-reaching implications. I said in my second lecture that the question, what it is that we know by understanding a comprehensive entity, makes an ontological reference to it. We have now given a more definite content to this ontology. Ue have shown that the kind of compre- hensive entities exemplified by skilful human performances are real things; as real as cobblestones and, in view of their far greater independence and power, much~ rea,l than cobblestones. It seems plausible then to generalise to all other instances of tacit know- ing that the structure of comprehension re-appears in the structure - of that which it comprehends and to go further and expect to find the structure of tacit !mowing duplicated in the principles which account for the stability and effectiveness of all real comprehen- sive entities. I shall sho11 now that this is in fact the case. ,.,. Tacit knowing can be destroyed by switching our attention from</p>\n<p>6 its comprehensive distal term, back to its proximal terms. Language offers a good example. Language has a meaning only when we tacitly rely on it for attending to that which it means. Switch your atten- tion back on a word you have spoken; repeat it several times, at- \u00b7: )&quot;&#x27;?~;.:.: ~ .. .;,i tendinljl: carefully to the motion of your tongue and lips, :and\u00b7 soon J ~ \u2022 tr&#x27; it will sound hollow and lose its meaning. The same is \u00b7ffde&quot; qf a skilful performance. Dy concentrating attention on his fingers, a pianist can paralyse himself; the motions of his fingers, having &#x27;\u00b7 lost their meaning, no longer bear on that which they had meant, which was the music performed by them, This destruction of tacit knowing is reversible. The word uttered again in its proper context; the pianist&#x27;s fingers used again with his mind on the music; they come to life and recover their meaning within their once more comprehended relationship. We can anti.cipate then the ontological characteristics of a comprehensive entity on--the following lines. \u00b7 1) Tacit knowing relies on our awareness of the particulars of an entity for attending to it. , \u00b7 2) If we switch our attention to the particulars, this func- tion of the particulars is cancelled and we lose sight of the entity to which we had attended. &#x27; The ontological counterpart of this would be 1) The principles controlling a\u00b7comprehensive entity would be found to rely for their operations on laws governing their particu- lars in themselves. 2) At the same time the laws governing the particulars in them- selves would never account for the organising principles of a higher entity which they form. Take our knowledge of a game of chess and the game itself. The playing of a game of chess is an entity controlled by principles which rely on the observance of the rules of chess; but the princi- ples controlling the game cannot be derived from the rules of chess.</p>\n<p>7 The two terms of tacit knowing, the proximal, which includes the particulars and the distal, which is their comprehensive meaning, would be seen then as two levels of reality, controlled by distinc- tive principles, so that the upper one relies for its operations \u00b7r\\?~..,..:~,.*-~\u2022 on the laws governing the elements of the lower one in tl:}emselves; . -!~U:-:~~ but that the operations of the higher level are not accountable by the laws of the lower level. In this sense, a logical relation holds between two such levels, a logical relation that corresponds . &#x27; to the fact that the two levels are the two terms of a tacit know- ing, which jointly apprehends them, I have spoken before of the way we interiorise bits of the universe, and thus populate it with comprehensive entities. The program which I have set out now 1\u00b71ould change this panorama. into a picture of the universe filled with strata of realities, joined logically together in pairs of a higher and a lower ohe. I could exemplify--this by analysing in these terms the various cases of tacit knowing that I have spolrnn. of before, but this would bring tedious repetitions. I shall rather give some new examples, which will take us a step further, by showing pairs of levels which tend to link up into a. series forminp; a hierarchy. Take the art of making brick11, \u00b7rt relies on its ra1\u00b71 materials placed on a level below it. Dut above the brick-maker there oper- ates the architect, relying on the brickmalrnr&#x27;s work, and the archi::: tect in his turn has to serve the town-planner, To these four suc- cessive levels there correspond four successive sets of rules that govern them. The laws of physics and chemistry govern the raw materials of brick-making; technology prescribes the art of brick-</p>\n<p>8 making; architecture teaches the builders and the rules of town planning control the town planners. My next example, which is the uttering of a set speech, will . prove more suited for the detailed examination of a hierarchic structure. It includes five levels; voice, 2) of words, 3) of sentences, \u00b7t \\;_~_:;,.:. ..... namely the productfoii. 1) of ... ~- . .\u2666..\\( \u00b7:\u00b7} ~ 4) of style, and $)&#x27;::of literary composition. Each of these levels is subject to its own laws: 1) of phonetics, 2) of lexicrography, 3) of grammar, 4) of stylis- &#x27; &#x27;. tics, and 5) of literary criticism. The principles of each level operate under the control of the next higher level. The voice you produce is shaped into words by a vocabulary; a given vocabulary is shaped into sentences in accordance with grammar; and the sen- tences can be made to fit into a style,. .. which in its turn is made to convey the ideas of a literary composition. Thus, each level is subject to dual control; first, by the la1-rn that apply to its elements in themselves~and, second, by the laws that control the comprehensive entity formed by them. Such is the structure of a hierarchy of comprehensive entities. In such a hierarchy, the operations of a higher level cannot &quot; be accounted for by the laws governing its particulars forming the lower level. You cannot derive a. vocabulary from phonetics; you cannot derive the grammar of a language from its vocabulary; a cor- rect use of grammar does not account for good style; and a good style does not provide the content of a piece of prose. We f&#x27;ind confirmed then throughout such a hierarchy what I said trhen I iden- tified the two terms of tacit knowing with two Joint levels of reality. It is impossible to represent the principles operating</p>\n<p>9 on a higher level by the laws governing its isolated particulars. This may seem too obvious to merit such emphasis~ but it will prove highly controversial, when I pass from hierarchies of human skills to the hierarchy of levels found in living beings. The \u00b7; ?~:.\u00b7:&lt;:!&#x27;&quot;\u2022:;\u2022~~.. . sequence of these levels is built up by the rise of hrgher \u00b7 f.orms of ,:;&quot;&#x27;;~~ i~ life from lower ones. We can see all the levels of evolution at a glance in an individual human being. The most primitive form of life is repre_sented by the growth of the typical human shape, through the process of morphogenesis, studied by embryology. Next we have the vegetative functioning of the organism, studied by physiology; and above it there is sentience, rising to perception and to a centrally controlled motoric ~ctivity, both of which still belong to physiology. We rise beyond this at the level of conscious behaviour and intellectual action, studied by ethology and psy- chology; and, uppermost, we meet with man 1s moral sense, guided by the firmament of his moral standards. I shall set aside, for the moment, the question, how far these consecutive levels form a hierarchy in our sense, and concentrate on the fact that all these levels are situated above that of the inanimate, and that hence they all rely for their operations--direct- ly or indirectly--on the laws of physics and chemistry that govern the inanimate. If we apply then the principle, that the operations of a higher level can never be derived from the laws governing its\u00b7 isolated particulars, it foll0\\&#x27;18 that none of these biotic opera- tions can be accounted for by the lavrs of physics and chemistry. Yet it is today taken for granted among biologists that all manifestations of life can ultimately be explained from the laws</p>\n<p>10 governing inanimate matter. K. S. Lashley declared this at the Hixon Symposium of 1948, as the common belief of all the partici- pants, without even consulting his distinguished colleagues. It was taken for granted. Yet this is patent nonsense ... \u00b7 /l&#x27;he most &#x27; ~--\u00b7_--\u00b7-- \u00b7:.\u2022~~4 The I &#x27;f~w.s of &gt; \u2022;.\u2022,\u2022U: -: i L \u00b7\u00b7.-\u20221:~- strikipg feature of our own lives is our sentience. physics and chemistry include no conception of sentience;\u00b7:and any system wholly determined by these laws, must be insentient. It may be in the interest of science to turn a blind eye on this cen- \u2022. tral fact of the universe (I shall yet come to this), but it is certainly not in the interest of truth. I shall prefer to follow up, on the contrary, the fact, that the study of life must ulti- mately reveal some principles addi~iona~ to those manifested by inanimate matter, and to prefigure the general outline of such, yet unknown, principles. I shall start by a scrutiny of the prevailing procedure of modern biologists. While the declared aim of current biology is to explain all the phenomena of life by the laws of physics and chemistry, its actual practice is to attempt an explanation in terms of a machinery, based on the laws of physics and chemistry. Biologists think that the substitution of this task for their . declared aim is justified, for they assume that a machine based on the laws of physics is explicable by the laws of physics. My first point is that biologists are mistaken in assuming this. Some authors have pointed out that machines have a purposive character 1\u00b71hich cannot be derived from the laws of physics and chemistry. This is true. Dut, to obtain the actual relat:tonsh1p between the principles of a machine and the laws governing its</p>\n<p>11 parts, we must consider the nature of a machine as a comprehensive entity. This will serve also to consolidate and deepen our concep- tion of the logical structure governing such entities, for in this case it is possible to define with a fair degree of pl&#x27;.le.qj.,t&#x27;lion the . . \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7*\u00b7\u00b7\u2022 .... \u00b7, ~-:--:. ; , relation by which the parts are integrated to the. entity !:tiP~Y form \u2022 . \u00b7 .. \u2022,;-.., I have presented this analysis often elsewhere, and shall therefore state only its main points here. &#x27; Machines\u00b7-are defined by their operational principles, which tell us how the machine works. These operational principles de- scribe the parts composing the machine, and define their several functions, by showing how they are made jointly to achieve the purpose which the machine is to serve; -The machine relies for its &quot; functions on certain physical and chemical properties of its parts and on certain physical-chemical processes- involved in their joint operation. ~ut little more may be required in this respect, than that the machine be solid and its material subject to the laws of mechanics. Hence, engineering and physics are two different sciences. Engineering includes the\u00b7 opera,tional principles of machines, and such knowledge of physics as bears on its operation. On the other hand, physics and chemistry include no knowledge of the operational principles of machines and hence a complete physical and chemical topography of a machine would not tell us whether it is a machine, and if so, how it works, and for what purpose .. Physical and chemical investigations of a machine are in fact meaningless, unless undertaken with a bearing on the previously established operational principles of the machine.</p>\n<p>12 Dut there is an important feature of machines, which its operational principles do not reveal: they never account for the failure and ultimate breakdown of machin1;1s. And here physics and chemistry effectively come in. Only the physical-chen\\i:c.al struc- . &#x27; . &quot;\u2022&#x27;&quot;&quot;&#x27;\u2022&#x27;\u00b7 ., ~;: &#x27;..,. ture of a machine can explain its failures, Liability ~-!91,-f~ilure is, as it were, the price paid for embodying operational-principles in a material subject to laws which ignore these principles. The &#x27; material in its blindness will eventually go its own ways and break the framework of intelligent design that forms it into a machine. We may asl{ how a machine which, as an inanimate body, obeys the laws of physics and chemistry, can fail to be determined by these laws? How can it follow both &#x27;t-he laws of nature and its &#x27;&#x27;\u00b7 operational principles as a machine? How does the shaping of inanimate matter in a machine make it capable of success or failure? The answer lies in the word: shaping. Natural laws may mould inanimate matter into distinctive shapes, such as the spheres of the sun and the moon and into such patterns as that of the solar system. Other shapes are imposed on matter artificially, and yet without infringing the laws of physics and chemistry. The opera- tional principles of machines are em~odied in matter by such arti- ficial shaping, These principles may be said to govern the border- line conditions of an inanimate system: the conditions that are explicitly left undetermined by the lavrn of physics and chemistry. Engineering provides a determination of such borderline conditions. And this is how an inanimate system can be subject to a dual control on two levels: the operations of the upper level are artificially embodied in the lower level which is relied on to obey the laws of</p>\n<p>, . 13 inanimate nature, i.e., physics and chemistry. I shall call the control exercised by the organisational prin- ciple of a higher level on its particulars forming its lower level, the principle of marginal control. This marginal principle could be recognised way I described some hierarchies of human performances. \u00b7 \u00b7You can see, for example, how, in the hierarchy constituting speechmaking, suc- cessive work.~ng principles control the borderline lef&#x27;t indeterminate on the next lower level, Voice production, which is the lowest level of speech, leaves largely open the combination of sounds to words, which is controlled by a vocabulary, Next, a vocabulary leaves largely open the combinatiqn,of words to f&#x27;orm sentences, which is controlled by grammar, ,\\nd s6\u2022\u00b7it goes on. Each lower level imposes restrictions on the one abo.ve it, even as the laws of inanimate nature restrict the practicability of conceivable machines. And again, as in machines, we may obser.ve that a higher operation may fail, when the next lower operations esc~pe its con- trol. In a broad way we .can see this principle of&#x27; marginal control operating also in the hierarchy of biotic levels. The vegetative system, sustaining life at rest, leaves open the possibilities of bodily motion by muscular action, and the principles of&#x27; muscular .\u2022 action leave open their integration to innate patterns of behaviour. Such patterns are open, in their turn, to be shaped by intelligence, the working of&#x27; which offers, once again, wide-ranging possibilities for the exercise of still higher principles in man&#x27;s responsible choices,</p>\n<p>14 These illustrations of the principle of marginal control should make it clear that it is equally present in artefacts, like machines; in human performances, like speech; and in living functions at all levels. It underlies the functions of all comprehen~i-v.e entities . \u00b7:\u00b7-,:,--&quot;&quot;t:.-.. ~:, . &#x27;&#x27; . _;\u00b7 ~..:.:~ ._, having a fixed structure. We may confidently rely, the:ref9re, on \u2022 &#x27;:\u2022\\~;-:. !_. L our analysis of machines, td declare that the predominant\u00b7view of biologists, that a mechanical explanation of living functions amounts to their explanation in terms of physics and chemistry, is false. Moreover, the conclusion that machines are defined by the fact that borderline conditions, expressly left open by physics and chemistry, are fixed according to principles foreign to physics and chemistry, maims it clear that what remains inexplicable by physics and chemis- try in a mechanically functioning part \u00b7,of life are its characteristic borderline conditions. This is not to deny that there is a great deal of truth in the mechanical explanation of life.. The organs of the body worl, much like machines, and they are subject to a hierarchy of controls, exercised by an ascending series of mechanical principles. Diolo- gists, pursuing the aim of explaining living functions in terms of machines have achieved astounding success. Dut this must not obscure the fact, that these advances only add to the features of life which cannot be represented in terms of laws noticeably manifested in the realm of inanimate nature. There is an important minority of biologists, who deny the possibility of representing all living functions by mechanisms of the kind known to enginee1\u2022ing and technology. The non-machine-like processes of life which they postulate, they call organismic. Such</p>\n<p>15 organismic processes are found at work in regeneration, and are most strikingly demonstrated by the embryonic regeneration of the sea urchin discovered by Hans Driesch. Driesch found _that through- out the gastrula stage any cell or combination from_;the embryo will develop into a normal sea an embryo having such regenerative powers as a of ce1ls detached -: -~~:\u00b7-;;.-:;,*~&quot; urchin&#x27;, &#x27;ifet (.described ,}$~};: &#x27;harmonious equipoten- tial&#x27; system. Such regeneration of the embryo from a fragment is known also -~s 1morphogenetic regulation&#x27;. In the process of embryonic development, we find a progressive limitation of equipotentiality due to the fixation of the prospects of the several areas of the embryo, This lends the embryo a mosaic character. Two principles are he!)c,e_forth combined in the develop- ment of the embryo. 1) Its division into a mosaic of areas having a fixed determination lends it a machine-like structure. 2) The . \u00b7 .. regulative powers which mutually adjust the several areas of fixed potentiality and which- preserve equipotentiality within each area, represent, on the other hand, an organi~mic principle. As matura- tion progresses, it leads to increasingly differentiated mechanical structures, and in eacp of these the scope of regulation is cor- respondingly reduced. Diologists who acknowledge a basic distinc- tion between mechanismic and organismic processes, consider living functions to be determined at all stages by a combination of mecha- nism and organismic regulation. Gestalt psychologists have often suggested that the processes of regulation are akin to the shaping of perception, but their in- sistence that both perceptual shaping and biological regulation are but the result of physical equilibriation, brought this suggestion</p>\n<p>,. 16 to a dead end. I agree with gestalt psychologists that the regula- tive powers of living beings and their mental powers of comprehen- sion are akin to each other, but I believe that they both embody principles that are not noticeable in the realm of in~mate nature . . . &#x27; \u00b7\u00b7\u2022~\u00b74 ., ~-\u00b7.;-: ; . , As the organismic processes observed by biologists,,~:q,:r!_1rig about : &#x27;: the emergence of novel structures operated by principles not present before, I shall identify first the occasions on which such emergence &#x27; takes place,&#x27;\u00b7 and identify morphegenetic regulation among them. Inanimate nature is self contained, achieving nothing, relying on nothing and hence, unerring. This fact defines the innovation achieved by the emergence of life from the inanimate . .All living things function, and a function necessarily has a result which it may achieve or fail to achieve. Thus processes that are expected to achieve something have a value and such value is inexplicable in terms of processes having no value, The logical impossibility of such an explanation may be affiliated to Hume&#x27;s dictum that nothing that ought to be, can be determined by knowing what is. We may conclude that a principle not noticeably present in the inanimate must come into operation when the inanimate brings forth living things. Dut the hierarchic structure of the higher forms of life neces- sitates the assumption of further processes of emergence, If each ,, higher level is to control the borderline left open by the opera- tions of the next lower level, this implies that these borderline conditions are in fact left open by the operations going on at the lower level. In other words, no level can gain control over its own borderline conditions and hence cannot bring into existence a higher</p>\n<p>, . 17 level, the operations of which consist precisely in controlling these borderline conditions. The logical structure of the hierarchy implies that a higher level can come into existence only by a pro- cess not manifest in the lower level, a process whicl&#x27;vthus qualifies \u00b7\u00b7,2\u00b7:r\u20221:;{\u2022 i.&#x27; as an &quot;emergence. .\\~~ti&#x27; Our understanding of this relationship can be deepen~d by con- sidering its mental counterpart. To the combination of organismic &#x27; and mechanical principles there corresponds in the mental field the combination of tacit comprehension with a set of fixed logical opera- tions. A child starts off with a scanty repertoire of&#x27; innate mental connections and enriches them rapidly by using his powers of compre- hension for establishing further f&#x27;\u00b7ixed.relations of experience. Piaget has described h01\u00b71 a child I s powe~s. of reasoning are _improved by developing increasingly stable rules of logical procedure. This development is stimulated by the interiorisation of language and of&#x27; its verbal culture. In this process the growing mind re-creates for itself the conceptual framework and the rules of reasoning bequeathed to it by its culture. Each of these fixations reduces the conceiv- able range of creative \u00b7innovations, but at the same time increases their power, by placing new tools at their disposal. This works like the anatomical differentiation of a developing organism, which narrows down its areas of equipotentiality, while offering in ex- change the use of a more powerful biotic machinery. We must have then two kinds of principles present in living beings that are not observable in inanimate nature. We have the principles Cl\\rrently running the hierarchic machinery of life, by controlling the margin left open by a principle below them, and</p>\n<p>, . 18 controlling ultimately the margin of physics and chemistry. And we must have a principle that supplies the innovating power for bringing these controlling principles into existence. They must be present in the growth\u00b7 of the germ cell into a mature,;i:i_~gal:&#x27;lism, where .. q&quot;&#x27;~\u2022--d they are recognised here as morphogenetic regulation, .-~n,d .. t)3ey must . ,:~\\~..;,.l ~ be present also in the process. of organic evolution by which higher forms of life have been brought forth from specks of protoplasm, as they were pr&#x27;~sent before, in the event, whlch first brought life into existence. Having drawn an analogy, amounting to kinship, between embryonic maturation and the intellectual development of the child, I clearly intend to claim now a kinship between the innovating powers of evolution and the powers of discovery \u00b71n science and technology. I shall indeed do so, as Henri Dergson has done before. I had this in mind already in my last lecture, when I spoke of supreme original- ity in science as a self transformation, achieving new. levels of existence. Dy this definition, originality coincides with emergence, as I defined it today. In order to re-consider the process of organic evolution in this sense, we must start by restoring the problem from its misrepre- sentation by the current theory of evolution. In my view, which I shall vindicate as I go along, the principal problem of evolution &lt;&#x27; lies in the rise of higher beings from lower ones and, principally~ in the rise of man. A theory which recognises only evolutionary changes due to the selective advantage of random mutations cannot acknowledge this problem. For the capacity to survive is no cri- terion of evolutionary achievement in my sense. There exist today</p>\n<p>, . 19 animals and plants on every evolutionary level. The lower species have of course survived up to date much longer than the higher ones and so their proven powers of survival are the greater. Dut even if it could be shown that, for some reason, life at a:~h:tgl)er level &#x27;. . \u00b7\u00b7\u2022--.:\u2022 . ;&quot; ! .. :;-~ : ~ succeeds better in surviving than at a lower level, this .111,0:tf):d not a\u2022_.,,-;-..._ l explain how higher forms of life have come into existence, .. any more than the fact that living things emerging from the inanimate have continued to live, explains the origin of life, The current theory of evolution could explain as easily--indeed more easily--the descent of the amoeba from man, as the actual rise of man from creatures like the amoeba. Hence it is not dealing with evolution at all. It is the height of intellectual perversion to renounce, in the name of scientific objectivity, our position as the highest form of life, which makes our ovm advent here by \u00b7a process of &#x27; evolution the central problem of evolution. The representation of evolution; as due to differential selec- tive advantage, has been assisted by shifting attention from evolu- tion to the origin of species. A preoccupation with the way popula-. tions of a new kind come into existence has made us lose sight of the more fundamental question, how any single individual of a higher species ever came into existence. I shall bring this problem into focus by surveying the historical antecedents of any single indi- vidual of a higher form. The origins of one man can be envisaged by tracing the mari 1s family tree all the way back to the primeval specks of protoplasm in which his first origins have lain. The history of this family tree includes everything that has contributed to the making of this</p>\n<p>20 human being. This segment of evolution is precisely on a par with the history of a fertilized egg developing into a mature man, or the history of a single plant growing from seed, which includes everything that caused that man, or that plant, to cQl&#x27;n!?;JJ};::o .. :&quot; ~;&#x27;&quot; existence. Natural selection plays no part in the evol~\\\\q~ of a single human being. We do not include in the mechanism of growth the possible adversities which d:l.d hot befall it and hence did not \u2022 prevent it. &#x27;-- The same holds for the evolution of a single human being; noth:1.ng is gained for understanding this evolution, by con- sidering the adverse chances which might nave prevented it. The distinction between the origin of species and the evolu- tionary origin of a single individual, is logically sharp, To represent changes in population as equivalent to the coming into existence of their members, is like sayirig that you catch a tiger by catching two and letting one go. It might help to keep the two conceptions apart if we coin a new name for the process by which we may call it an ideogenesis as distinct from a phylogenesis. The study of ideogenesis does not disregard the occurrence of accidental mutations which may prove adaptive. It merely assumes that these can be distinguished from changes of type achieving new levels of existence. Most palaeozoists i1ould agree that, though this distinction is often difficult, it is none the less valid. And - once this obvious distinction is allowed for, the thrust of evolu- tionary rise is as clearly manifest, as the growth of an individual from a germ cell. It is widely accepted today that philosophy must leave the study of nature strictly to science. I must explain why I am offend-</p>\n<p>21 ing against this injunction. I am doing this simply in the interest of truth, and I expect that scientists will see my point. For I do not think that they believe that what they say in these matters is true. For example, when the great Lashley (1948).Jna,de the absurd &#x27; ~~ ... -~~ ~.,~:4 statement that all mental processes must be ultimatery eb[pl.a.ined by . ,:~~;~~t ~ physics and chemistry, his purpose was merely to exclude\u00b7any sugges- tions that we should explain mental processes by an infringement of the laws of\\inanimate matter in the nervous system. Other such statements, even more obviously absurd, made byO. Hebb, (1954) clearly show this pragmatic intention. Since he sur\u00b7ely did not want neurophysiologists to assume that all their subjects are uncon- scious, he can have meant this admoni~ion only as a guide to the theoretical interpretation of neurological findings. This is ap- parent from an account of the situation given by the psychiatrist L. S, Kubie on the very occasion when Hebb spoke in the terms I have quoted. Kubie said he regarded consciousness as an indispensa- ble \u2022working concept&#x27; for psychology and went on to say &quot;Sometimes we are explicit and frank about this. Sometimes we fool ourselves about it. Many workers have attempted to avoid using the ~,ord because of its traditional connotations . II The practice of such deliberate ambiguities is rreely admitted in biology. Everyone knows that you cannot enquire into the func- tions of living organisms without referring to the purpose served\u00b7 by them and by the organs and processes that belong to them. Yet we must pretend that all such teleological explanations are merely provisional. The story goes round among biologists everyNhere that teleology is a woman of easy virtue, whom the biologist disowns in</p>\n<p>22 public, but lives with in private. The steady rise of higher organisms from lower ones, from which this digression started, is also a case in point. Teilhard de Chardin P. D. Medawar reproved him for In an article on \u00b7!\\a\u2022?~.:.:.., ... suggem-:ing that l &#x27; - ~ :, &quot;evolution has a main track and privileged axis&quot;, yet inYt+ie same article Medawar offers his own explanation for this very fact. Scientists may be right in recommending, and indeed enforcing, certain basic assumptions that are obviously false. The assumption that man is an insentient automation, which no one can believe to be true, has kept neurophysiology on the track of many beautiful discoveries, which perhaps could not have been made otherwise. Dut these technical fictions are not binding on the outsider. However widely the working assumptions of science may lead to ever new dis- coveries, we must not allow them to falsify the image of man and the universe and depriving it of all meaning. And if science, for very good reasons, cannot undertake the task of giving us a reasonable view of the universe, we must take the matter into our own hands, in which scientists should help us, as ordinary people, outside the laboratory. Ordinary people have anticipated in many fundamental respects the knowledge on which biology is based. Animals and plants were recognised before zoology and botany; health and sickness before pathology; the contrast be-.,~ tween sentience and insentience, between intelligence and its absence, were known before they were studied by science. These were common knowledge, and so were many details of living functions, lil,e hunger for food, need for breath, the processes of digestion, elimination and secretion, the functions of our senses, the process of procrea-</p>\n<p>, . 23 tion, of embryological development, of growth and maturation, of senescence. One could go on without end enumerating the subjects which biologists took over from popular knowledge. I want us, ordinary men, to exercise once more our basic inter- -\u00b7 . -~ \\?.:..;:. _:;.-~:,; pretative powers, for establishing a basic understanding&#x27;&quot;:of the ., &#x27;.,., evolution by which man has come into existence. &#x27;:!!:\u00b5;~ t ~ The principle we must apply is the same as that by which we see the fingers of our hand and by which Copernicus saw the earth \u2022,. circling the sun. It is the principle underlying the mental life of both animals and men, which tells us that things that hang to- gether are real and significant and that all such coherence presents a problem, for what hangs together in one way is lilrnly to hang together also in other ways, yet to be\u2022.,discovered in the future. The rise of man, of any single human being from inanimate begin- nings is such a massively coherent fact, unrivalled &#x27;in the number and distinctiveness o~ the relations composing it. To see this image, free of the false clues of selec_!;ionism, is to recognise that we are facing a constructive power of the universe that has culmi- nated, so far, in bringing ourselves into existence. The Copernican image of celestial motions evoked the theory of universal gi;&#x27;avitation which accounted for the central position of the sun. Evolution, conceived as ideogenesis, recognises man as the peak of creation, as the Dible had done in the language of \u00b7religion. Of the universal principles under which this achievement has taken place, we can discern some already in outline. One is the stratified structure of living things, which makes ideogenesis a process of radical innovation; another is the princj_ple</p>\n<p>, .. 24 which identifies the emergence of new levels of existence with the heuristic powers of tacit knowing. A further principle, which will link emergence with the responsible choices made in an act of crea- tive thought, will be outlined in my next le_cture. \u00b7:j:~-~.;.:~,..;.~4 l.-have not hesitated to value the more comprehensiv&amp;&#x27;&quot;&#x27;l.evels of ).1)&#x27; ~.\\:-&#x27; &#x27;----~-,;., t&quot; life as the higher forms of existence, for the absence of: .value judg- ments in science is but a pretence, which, if followed strictly, would render. biology blind not only to evolution, but to life itself. For the value of life comes into existence with life itself. Dut while there is a gradual intensification of value through- out the evolution of man, the emergence of these values is accom- panied at every step by an additional liability to miscarry. The capacity for growth, by which living things acquire their typical shapes, may produce malformations; physio_logical functions are sub- ject to disabling and eventually mortal diseases; perception, drive satisfaction, and learning, bring with them new failings by falling into error; and finally, man is found not. only liable to a far greater range of errors than animals are, but by virtue of his moral sense, becomes c~pable also of evil. This parallel development of capabilities and liabilities is accompanied by a consolidation of. the center to which these are attributable. Life exists predominantly in the form of individuals. nut at the vegetative level, as we have in plants, individuality i&lt;f still weak. The center of the individual becomes more pronounced with the rise of animal activities, and it grows more marked still in the exercise of intelligence. It rises to the level of person- hood in man. And again, every additional function with which the</p>\n<p>center is credited, exposes it to new reproaches, in respect of new failures. 25 Thus, each new branch of biology that was developed to cover the increasingly complex function of higher animals sets up addi- \u00b7r f?~~,;.\u00b7~\u2022~=\u2022 tional,- standards, to which the observer expects the anima-r t\u00b7o come &#x27;:f~i~ }:~&#x27; up. And this intensification of criticism coincides with&#x27;an in- creasing enrichment of relations between the critic and his object. He know an animal, as we know a person, by entering into its per- formance and we appreciate it as an individual, in the interests of which these performances have their meaning. Even at the lowest, purely vegetative, level, we accept the interests of the animal as the standard by which our own interest in the animal is justified. All biology is, in this sense, convivia1. Dut this conviviality rises to emotional concern as the animal approaches the human level. We then become aware of its sentience, of its intelli&#x27;gence, and above all of its emotional relations to ourselves. Yet, however greatly we may love an animal, there is a reeling, which no animal can deserve, yet is commonly given to our fellowmen. I have said that at the, highest level of manhood, we meet man 1s moral sense, guided by the firmament of his standards. Even when this appears absent, its mere possibility is sufficient to evol,e our respect. We have here a fact that casts a new major task on the process,. of evolution; a task which appears the more formidable as we realise that both this moral sense and our respect for it, presuppose an obedience to commands accepted in defiance to the immemorial scheme of self-preservation, dominating the evolutionary process up to this point.</p>\n<p>26 Yet evolution must make sense also of this afterthought to five hundred million years of pure self-seeking. And in a way this prob- lem can be put in biological terms. lror this potentiality for obedience to higher demands is largely involved in man 1s capacity for anc::&gt;ther peculiarly human relation to other men, ~1\\i1il,t&amp; ,the . . ~ ..... :. capacity to feel reverence for men greater than himself/ft&#x27;i evolu- .. \u00b7~ . tion is to include the rise of man, with all his sense of&#x27;higher obligations,, it must include also the rise of human greatness. In my last lecture I shall expand the panorama of a universe that I have sketched out so far, to include man&#x27;s cultural equipment and this should offer us a frameworl{ within which we can define responsible human action, of which man&#x27;s moral decisions form but a particular instance.</p>",
    "content_text": "The Emergence of Man \nby Michael Polanyi \n(lis delivered on March 2, 1964 at Duke University) \nAt the end of my first lecture I said that the C9P,ei;-nican \n'. ~-.. _.\u2022-'1\"\"' ~-~ \nrevolut-ion, completed by Newton, has placed on\u00b7 the same/ 1fJe,1,: the \n. ':';~--H\u00b7 \nultimate components of all things, including those of mari\u2022and of \n. ' \nthe thoughts of man. \nEver<Jthing in the world would be explicable \nthen by the laws governing these uniform ultimate components. \nNo \nadditional higher principle would be at work in them; there would, \nin fact, be only one level of existence in the world. \nDut I \nopposed this world view and promised that once we credit ourselves \nwith genuine pouers of integration., we shall see the structure or \nour comprehens\u00b7ion re-appear in the structure of that which we com-\nprehend. \nWe shall be able to uphold the existence of genuinely \n. \n' \nhigher entities, not altogether determined by the laws to which \ntheir ultimate components are subject. \n* \nI have shown how we participate in the world by understanding \nit. \nWe know all the complex things we see around us, whether inani-\nmate or living, dumb or intelligent, by relying on our awareness of \ntheir parts for attending to them as wholes, and this process is \nlogically equivalent to using their parts as we use our own body \nfor attending to things outside it. Thus we form an interpreted \n__.,. \nuniverse populated by entities, the particulars of which we have \ninteriorised for the sake of comprehending their meaning in the \nshape of coherent entities. \nConsider now the situation when two nersons share the l<nowledge \n-- . \nof the same comprehensive entity--of an entity which one of them \ny \n\n2 \nproduces and the other apprehends, \nSuch is the case when one \nperson has made a communication and the other has received it. Dut \nthe characteristic features of the situation are seen more clearly \nif we consider the way one man gets to understand a skilful per-\nformance of another man. \nHe must try mentally to com-h:1-'n~.,,the move-\n. w., \n!.,.:;~: ; _ r \nments, of the performer to the same pattern to ~rhich the !-ioetformer \n.. -: .... \n-~ . \ncombines them practically, \nTwo kinds of indwelling meet here. \nThe \nperformer coordinates his moves by dwelling in them as parts of his \nbody, while \u00b7the person who watches him tries to correlate these \nmoves by seeking to dwell in them from outside. \nHe dwells in these \nmoves by interiorising them. \nDy such exploratory ind,\u2022relling the \npupil gets the feel of a master's skill and may learn to rival him. \nNor is this structural kinship'between subject and object, \nand the indwelling of one in the other, present only in the study \nof a bodily performance. \nChess players enter into a master's spirit \nby rehearsing the games he played, to discover what he had in mind. \nWhen entering and dwelling in comprehensive entities of this \nkind, we meet something that accounts for the coherence of the \nentity. \nIn one case we meet a person skilfully using his body and, \n' \nin the other, a person cleverly using his mind. \nThe recognition of a person in the performance of a skill or \nin the conduct of a game of chess is intrinsic to the understanding \nof these achievements, \nWe must surmise that we are faced with \nsome coordinated performance, before we can even try to understand \nit, and must go on to pick out the features that are essential to \nthe performance, with a view to the action felt to be at work in \nit. Hence, the question, much discussed by philosophers, how we \n\n3 \ncan infer--explicitly infer--the existence of other minds, from \nobserving their external worl,ings, does not arise, for we never do \nobserve these worl<ings in themselves. \nIndeed, many of them we could \nnot identify, even after \\'le have successfully integrated them to \n. \n., \u00b7.,.:)\u00b7-.. \nour knowledge of a personal performance, any more tha\u00b7n\u00b7:Jt'!3\".,',PE,rformer \n-\n-.: \u2022.: \n\u2022 \nI \n.. '.. i j, \ncould tell us, except quite vaguely, what the particulars-:!la..re that \nhis performance coordinates, \nThis is.not to say that we gain an understanding of the mind \n\u2022\u00b7. \nwithout a process of enquiry. \nDut the enquiry consists, like a \nscientific enquiry, in picking out clues as such, that is, with a \npresumed bearing on the presence of something they appear to indi-\ncate. \nAnd as in a scientific enquiry, many of the clues used will \nremain unidentifiable and may indeed be~ subliminal, \nSuch is the \n\" \neffort by which we enter into the intimate structure of a skill or \nof a game of chess and get to know the powers of the person behind \nit. The method by whicJ:l a historian explores a historic personality, \nis an expansion of this way of knowing. \nThe structural kinnhip. between knowing a mind and pursuing a \nscientific enquiry throws light on some further points obscured by \nthe false assumption that we start acquiring the knowledge of a \nmind by observing the workings of the mind in themselves. It tells \nus that the mind is unsubstantial only in the sense in which a good \nproblem is unsubstantial, \nIndeed, a great mind is an inexhaustible~ \n. , \nand rewarding problem to the historian and literary scholar, and \nevery human person is of infinite concern to one who cares for him. \nDut neither problems nor minds should on this account be set far \napart from other things, \nFor an inanimate solid object, too, is \n\n4 \nknown \nby understanding its particulars, from which we attend to it \nas an object, \nThis brings up a question similar to that I have just spoken \nof in respect of our knowledge of other minds, \nThe question is \n\u00b7l f~-:.;-t-:,.-,:,a \nnow ho}'I' we infer the existence of a permanent. object, \u00b7fronf' observ-\ning its sensible qualities. \n,};tt~}~-\nAnal~rtic philosophers would dispose \nof this problem by denying that we ever see anything but objects. \nIlut this is not true. \nWe do see the several parts of a camouflaged \n\u00b7\u00b7\u2022 \nobject as mere patches, and can break down this deception then by \nan effort to see these fragments meaningfully as an object. \nThese \nphilosophers are right in pointing out that no process of explicit \ninference takes place either in getting to know a mind, or in see-\ning a cobblestone, and that it is fruitless, therefore, to enquire \nin the way such an inference is conducted; they overlook the fact \nthat we do get to !{now solid objects only by a tacit integration \nof their parts, l'lhich may require a difficult intellectual effort. \nThe examples which I have quoted point at a new aspect of this \n., \nproblem of philosophy. \nThe structural kinship between knowing a \nperson and discovering \u00a71, problem, and the alignment of both with \nour knowing of a cobblestone, call attention to the greater depth \nof a person and a problem, as compared with the lesser profundity \nof a cobblestone. \nPersons and problems are felt to be more pro-\nfound, because we expect them to reveal themselves more richly and/ \nunexpectedly in the future. \nSince I have attributed the capacity \nof things to reveal themselves inexhaustibly in the future, to the \nfact that they are an aspect of reality, I shall say that minds and \nproblems possess a d9eper reality than cobblestones, even though \n\n5 \ncobblestones are more tangible, \nAnd since the significance of a \nthing is more important than its tangibility, I shall say that \nminds and problems are more real than cobblestones. \nWith this settled, we can say now also that manfii.:s~J,Jful \n., \n!,....!\"~ . ' , \nexercise of his body is a real entity that another pers9n,r~in !mow, \nand know only, by comprehending it, and that the comprehension of \nthis real entity has the same structure as the entity which is its \n\\. \nobject. \nAnd \u00b7\u00b7we may likewise say--to drive the point home--that \nthe skilful conduct of a game of chess by another person is a real \nentity, knowable by our tacit comprehension of it, and that this \ncomprehension is similar in structure to that which it comprehends. \nYou may feel that I have been\u00b7s1ow in drawing this conclusion. \nDut I had to make quite sure of it, for it carries far-reaching \nimplications. \nI said in my second lecture that the question, what \nit is that we know by understanding a comprehensive entity, makes \nan ontological reference to it. \nWe have now given a more definite \ncontent to this ontology. \nUe have shown that the kind of compre-\nhensive entities exemplified by skilful human performances are real \nthings; as real as cobblestones and, in view of their far greater \nindependence and power, much~ rea,l than cobblestones. It seems \nplausible then to generalise to all other instances of tacit know-\ning that the structure of comprehension re-appears in the structure -\nof that which it comprehends and to go further and expect to find \nthe structure of tacit !mowing duplicated in the principles which \naccount for the stability and effectiveness of all real comprehen-\nsive entities. \nI shall sho11 now that this is in fact the case. \n,.,. \nTacit knowing can be destroyed by switching our attention from \n\n6 \nits comprehensive distal term, back to its proximal terms. \nLanguage \noffers a good example. \nLanguage has a meaning only when we tacitly \nrely on it for attending to that which it means. \nSwitch your atten-\ntion back on a word you have spoken; repeat it several times, at-\n\u00b7: )\"'?~;.:.: ~ .. .;,i \ntendinljl: carefully to the motion of your tongue and lips, :and\u00b7 soon \nJ \n~ \u2022 tr' \nit will sound hollow and lose its meaning. \nThe same is \u00b7ffde\" qf a \nskilful performance. \nDy concentrating attention on his fingers, a \npianist can paralyse himself; the motions of his fingers, having \n'\u00b7 \nlost their meaning, no longer bear on that which they had meant, \nwhich was the music performed by them, \nThis destruction of tacit knowing is reversible. \nThe word \nuttered again in its proper context; the pianist's fingers used \nagain with his mind on the music; they come to life and recover \ntheir meaning within their once more comprehended relationship. \nWe can anti.cipate then the ontological characteristics of a \ncomprehensive entity on--the following lines. \n\u00b7 1) Tacit knowing relies on our awareness of the particulars \nof an entity for attending to it. \n, \u00b7 \n2) If we switch our attention to the particulars, this func-\ntion of the particulars is cancelled and we lose sight of the \nentity to which we had attended. \n' \nThe ontological counterpart of this would be \n1) The principles controlling a\u00b7comprehensive entity would be \nfound to rely for their operations on laws governing their particu-\nlars in themselves. \n2) At the same time the laws governing the particulars in them-\nselves would never account for the organising principles of a higher \nentity which they form. \nTake our knowledge of a game of chess and the game itself. The \nplaying of a game of chess is an entity controlled by principles \nwhich rely on the observance of the rules of chess; but the princi-\nples controlling the game cannot be derived from the rules of chess. \n\n7 \nThe two terms of tacit knowing, the proximal, which includes the \nparticulars and the distal, which is their comprehensive meaning, \nwould be seen then as two levels of reality, controlled by distinc-\ntive principles, so that the upper one relies for its operations \n\u00b7r\\?~..,..:~,.*-~\u2022 \non the laws governing the elements of the lower one in tl:}emselves; \n. \n-!~U:-:~~ \nbut that the operations of the higher level are not accountable by \nthe laws of the lower level. \nIn this sense, a logical relation \nholds between two such levels, a logical relation that corresponds \n. \n' \nto the fact that the two levels are the two terms of a tacit know-\ning, which jointly apprehends them, \nI have spoken before of the way we interiorise bits of the \nuniverse, and thus populate it with comprehensive entities. \nThe \nprogram which I have set out now 1\u00b71ould change this panorama. into a \npicture of the universe filled with strata of realities, joined \nlogically together in pairs of a higher and a lower ohe. \nI could exemplify--this by analysing in these terms the various \ncases of tacit knowing that I have spolrnn. of before, but this would \nbring tedious repetitions. \nI shall rather give some new examples, \nwhich will take us a step further, by showing pairs of levels which \ntend to link up into a. series forminp; a hierarchy. \nTake the art of making brick11, \u00b7rt relies on its ra1\u00b71 materials \nplaced on a level below it. Dut above the brick-maker there oper-\nates the architect, relying on the brickmalrnr's work, and the archi::: \ntect in his turn has to serve the town-planner, \nTo these four suc-\ncessive levels there correspond four successive sets of rules that \ngovern them. \nThe laws of physics and chemistry govern the raw \nmaterials of brick-making; technology prescribes the art of brick-\n\n8 \nmaking; architecture teaches the builders and the rules of town \nplanning control the town planners. \nMy next example, which is the uttering of a set speech, will \n. prove more suited for the detailed examination of a hierarchic \nstructure. It includes five levels; \nvoice, 2) of words, 3) of sentences, \n\u00b7t \\;_~_:;,.:. ..... \nnamely the productfoii. 1) of \n... ~-\n. \n.\u2666..\\( \u00b7:\u00b7} ~ \n4) of style, and $)'::of literary \ncomposition. \nEach of these levels is subject to its own laws: \n1) of phonetics, 2) of lexicrography, 3) of grammar, 4) of stylis-\n' '. \ntics, and 5) of literary criticism. \nThe principles of each level \noperate under the control of the next higher level. \nThe voice you \nproduce is shaped into words by a vocabulary; a given vocabulary \nis shaped into sentences in accordance with grammar; and the sen-\ntences can be made to fit into a style,. .. which in its turn is made \nto convey the ideas of a literary composition. \nThus, each level \nis subject to dual control; first, by the la1-rn that apply to its \nelements in themselves~and, second, by the laws that control the \ncomprehensive entity formed by them. \nSuch is the structure of a \nhierarchy of comprehensive entities. \nIn such a hierarchy, the operations of a higher level cannot \n\" \nbe accounted for by the laws governing its particulars forming the \nlower level. \nYou cannot derive a. vocabulary from phonetics; you \ncannot derive the grammar of a language from its vocabulary; a cor-\nrect use of grammar does not account for good style; and a good \nstyle does not provide the content of a piece of prose. \nWe f'ind \nconfirmed then throughout such a hierarchy what I said trhen I iden-\ntified the two terms of tacit knowing with two Joint levels of \nreality. It is impossible to represent the principles operating \n\n9 \non a higher level by the laws governing its isolated particulars. \nThis may seem too obvious to merit such emphasis~ but it will \nprove highly controversial, when I pass from hierarchies of human \nskills to the hierarchy of levels found in living beings. \nThe \n\u00b7; ?~:.\u00b7:<:!'\"\u2022:;\u2022~~.. . \nsequence of these levels is built up by the rise of hrgher \u00b7 f.orms of \n,:;\"';~~ i~ \nlife from lower ones. \nWe can see all the levels of evolution at a \nglance in an individual human being. \nThe most primitive form of \nlife is repre_sented by the growth of the typical human shape, \nthrough the process of morphogenesis, studied by embryology. \nNext \nwe have the vegetative functioning of the organism, studied by \nphysiology; and above it there is sentience, rising to perception \nand to a centrally controlled motoric ~ctivity, both of which still \nbelong to physiology. \nWe rise beyond this at the level of conscious \nbehaviour and intellectual action, studied by ethology and psy-\nchology; and, uppermost, we meet with man 1s moral sense, guided by \nthe firmament of his moral standards. \nI shall set aside, for the moment, the question, how far these \nconsecutive levels form a hierarchy in our sense, and concentrate \non the fact that all these levels are situated above that of the \ninanimate, and that hence they all rely for their operations--direct-\nly or indirectly--on the laws of physics and chemistry that govern \nthe inanimate. If we apply then the principle, that the operations \nof a higher level can never be derived from the laws governing its\u00b7 \nisolated particulars, it foll0\\'18 that none of these biotic opera-\ntions can be accounted for by the lavrs of physics and chemistry. \nYet it is today taken for granted among biologists that all \nmanifestations of life can ultimately be explained from the laws \n\n10 \ngoverning inanimate matter. \nK. S. Lashley declared this at the \nHixon Symposium of 1948, as the common belief of all the partici-\npants, without even consulting his distinguished colleagues. It \nwas taken for granted. \nYet this is patent nonsense ... \u00b7 /l'he most \n' ~--\u00b7_--\u00b7-- \u00b7:.\u2022~~4 \nThe I 'f~w.s of \n> \u2022;.\u2022,\u2022U: -: i L \n\u00b7\u00b7.-\u20221:~-\nstrikipg feature of our own lives is our sentience. \nphysics and chemistry include no conception of sentience;\u00b7:and any \nsystem wholly determined by these laws, must be insentient. It \nmay be in the interest of science to turn a blind eye on this cen-\n\u2022. \ntral fact of the universe (I shall yet come to this), but it is \ncertainly not in the interest of truth. \nI shall prefer to follow \nup, on the contrary, the fact, that the study of life must ulti-\nmately reveal some principles addi~iona~ to those manifested by \ninanimate matter, and to prefigure the general outline of such, \nyet unknown, principles. \nI shall start by a scrutiny of the prevailing procedure of \nmodern biologists. \nWhile the declared aim of current biology is \nto explain all the phenomena of life by the laws of physics and \nchemistry, its actual practice is to attempt an explanation in \nterms of a machinery, based on the laws of physics and chemistry. \nBiologists think that the substitution of this task for their \n. \ndeclared aim is justified, for they assume that a machine based on \nthe laws of physics is explicable by the laws of physics. \nMy first \npoint is that biologists are mistaken in assuming this. \nSome authors have pointed out that machines have a purposive \ncharacter 1\u00b71hich cannot be derived from the laws of physics and \nchemistry. \nThis is true. \nDut, to obtain the actual relat:tonsh1p \nbetween the principles of a machine and the laws governing its \n\n11 \nparts, we must consider the nature of a machine as a comprehensive \nentity. \nThis will serve also to consolidate and deepen our concep-\ntion of the logical structure governing such entities, for in this \ncase it is possible to define with a fair degree of pl'.le.qj.,t'lion the \n. . \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7*\u00b7\u00b7\u2022 \n.... \u00b7, \n~-:--:. ; , \nrelation by which the parts are integrated to the. entity !:tiP~Y form \u2022 \n. \u00b7 .. \u2022,;-.., \nI have presented this analysis often elsewhere, and shall therefore \nstate only its main points here. \n' \nMachines\u00b7-are defined by their operational principles, which \ntell us how the machine works. \nThese operational principles de-\nscribe the parts composing the machine, and define their several \nfunctions, by showing how they are made jointly to achieve the \npurpose which the machine is to serve; -The machine relies for its \n\" \nfunctions on certain physical and chemical properties of its parts \nand on certain physical-chemical processes- involved in their joint \noperation. \n~ut little more may be required in this respect, than \nthat the machine be solid and its material subject to the laws of \nmechanics. \nHence, engineering and physics are two different sciences. \nEngineering includes the\u00b7 opera,tional principles of machines, and \nsuch knowledge of physics as bears on its operation. \nOn the other \nhand, physics and chemistry include no knowledge of the operational \nprinciples of machines and hence a complete physical and chemical \ntopography of a machine would not tell us whether it is a machine, \nand if so, how it works, and for what purpose .. Physical and \nchemical investigations of a machine are in fact meaningless, unless \nundertaken with a bearing on the previously established operational \nprinciples of the machine. \n\n12 \nDut there is an important feature of machines, which its \noperational principles do not reveal: \nthey never account for the \nfailure and ultimate breakdown of machin1;1s. \nAnd here physics and \nchemistry effectively come in. \nOnly the physical-chen\\i:c.al struc-\n. \n' \n. \"\u2022'\"\"'\u2022'\u00b7 \n., \n~;: '..,. \nture of a machine can explain its failures, \nLiability ~-!91,-f~ilure \nis, as it were, the price paid for embodying operational-principles \nin a material subject to laws which ignore these principles. \nThe \n' \nmaterial in its blindness will eventually go its own ways and break \nthe framework of intelligent design that forms it into a machine. \nWe may asl{ how a machine which, as an inanimate body, obeys \nthe laws of physics and chemistry, can fail to be determined by \nthese laws? \nHow can it follow both 't-he laws of nature and its \n''\u00b7 \noperational principles as a machine? \nHow does the shaping of \ninanimate matter in a machine make it capable of success or failure? \nThe answer lies in the word: \nshaping. \nNatural laws may mould \ninanimate matter into distinctive shapes, such as the spheres of \nthe sun and the moon and into such patterns as that of the solar \nsystem. \nOther shapes are imposed on matter artificially, and yet \nwithout infringing the laws of physics and chemistry. \nThe opera-\ntional principles of machines are em~odied in matter by such arti-\nficial shaping, \nThese principles may be said to govern the border-\nline conditions of an inanimate system: \nthe conditions that are \nexplicitly left undetermined by the lavrn of physics and chemistry. \nEngineering provides a determination of such borderline conditions. \nAnd this is how an inanimate system can be subject to a dual control \non two levels: \nthe operations of the upper level are artificially \nembodied in the lower level which is relied on to obey the laws of \n\n, . \n13 \ninanimate nature, i.e., physics and chemistry. \nI shall call the control exercised by the organisational prin-\nciple of a higher level on its particulars forming its lower level, \nthe principle of marginal control. \nThis marginal principle could be recognised \nway I described some hierarchies of human performances. \u00b7 \u00b7You can see, \nfor example, how, in the hierarchy constituting speechmaking, suc-\ncessive work.~ng principles control the borderline lef't indeterminate \non the next lower level, \nVoice production, which is the lowest \nlevel of speech, leaves largely open the combination of sounds to \nwords, which is controlled by a vocabulary, \nNext, a vocabulary \nleaves largely open the combinatiqn,of words to f'orm sentences, \nwhich is controlled by grammar, \n,\\nd s6\u2022\u00b7it goes on. \nEach lower \nlevel imposes restrictions on the one abo.ve it, even as the laws \nof inanimate nature restrict the practicability of conceivable \nmachines. \nAnd again, as in machines, we may obser.ve that a higher \noperation may fail, when the next lower operations esc~pe its con-\ntrol. \nIn a broad way we .can see this principle of' marginal control \noperating also in the hierarchy of biotic levels. \nThe vegetative \nsystem, sustaining life at rest, leaves open the possibilities of \nbodily motion by muscular action, and the principles of' muscular \n.\u2022 \naction leave open their integration to innate patterns of behaviour. \nSuch patterns are open, in their turn, to be shaped by intelligence, \nthe working of' which offers, once again, wide-ranging possibilities \nfor the exercise of still higher principles in man's responsible \nchoices, \n\n14 \nThese illustrations of the principle of marginal control should \nmake it clear that it is equally present in artefacts, like machines; \nin human performances, like speech; and in living functions at all \nlevels. It underlies the functions of all comprehen~i-v.e entities \n. \u00b7:\u00b7-,:,--\"\"t:.-.. \n~:, \n. \n'' \n. \n_;\u00b7 \n~..:.:~ ._, \nhaving a fixed structure. \nWe may confidently rely, the:ref9re, on \n\u2022 \n':\u2022\\~;-:. !_. L \nour analysis of machines, td declare that the predominant\u00b7view of \nbiologists, that a mechanical explanation of living functions amounts \nto their explanation in terms of physics and chemistry, is false. \nMoreover, the conclusion that machines are defined by the fact that \nborderline conditions, expressly left open by physics and chemistry, \nare fixed according to principles foreign to physics and chemistry, \nmaims it clear that what remains inexplicable by physics and chemis-\ntry in a mechanically functioning part \u00b7,of life are its characteristic \nborderline conditions. \nThis is not to deny that there is a great deal of truth in the \nmechanical explanation of life.. The organs of the body worl, much \nlike machines, and they are subject to a hierarchy of controls, \nexercised by an ascending series of mechanical principles. Diolo-\ngists, pursuing the aim of explaining living functions in terms of \nmachines have achieved astounding success. \nDut this must not obscure \nthe fact, that these advances only add to the features of life which \ncannot be represented in terms of laws noticeably manifested in the \nrealm of inanimate nature. \nThere is an important minority of biologists, who deny the \npossibility of representing all living functions by mechanisms of \nthe kind known to enginee1\u2022ing and technology. \nThe non-machine-like \nprocesses of life which they postulate, they call organismic. Such \n\n15 \norganismic processes are found at work in regeneration, and are \nmost strikingly demonstrated by the embryonic regeneration of the \nsea urchin discovered by Hans Driesch. \nDriesch found _that through-\nout the gastrula stage any cell or combination \nfrom_;the embryo will develop into a normal sea \nan embryo having such regenerative powers as a \nof ce1ls detached \n-: -~~:\u00b7-;;.-:;,*~\" \nurchin', 'ifet (.described \n,}$~};: \n'harmonious equipoten-\ntial' system. \nSuch regeneration of the embryo from a fragment is \nknown also -~s \n1morphogenetic regulation'. \nIn the process of embryonic development, we find a progressive \nlimitation of equipotentiality due to the fixation of the prospects \nof the several areas of the embryo, \nThis lends the embryo a mosaic \ncharacter. \nTwo principles are he!)c,e_forth combined in the develop-\nment of the embryo. \n1) Its division into a mosaic of areas having \na fixed determination lends it a machine-like structure. \n2) The \n. \n\u00b7 .. \nregulative powers which mutually adjust the several areas of fixed \npotentiality and which- preserve equipotentiality within each area, \nrepresent, on the other hand, an organi~mic principle. \nAs matura-\ntion progresses, it leads to increasingly differentiated mechanical \nstructures, and in eacp of these the scope of regulation is cor-\nrespondingly reduced. \nDiologists who acknowledge a basic distinc-\ntion between mechanismic and organismic processes, consider living \nfunctions to be determined at all stages by a combination of mecha-\nnism and organismic regulation. \nGestalt psychologists have often suggested that the processes \nof regulation are akin to the shaping of perception, but their in-\nsistence that both perceptual shaping and biological regulation are \nbut the result of physical equilibriation, brought this suggestion \n\n,. \n16 \nto a dead end. \nI agree with gestalt psychologists that the regula-\ntive powers of living beings and their mental powers of comprehen-\nsion are akin to each other, but I believe that they both embody \nprinciples that are not noticeable in the realm of in~mate nature . \n. . \n' \u00b7\u00b7\u2022~\u00b74 \n., \n~-\u00b7.;-: ; . , \nAs the organismic processes observed by biologists,,~:q,:r!_1rig about \n: ': \nthe emergence of novel structures operated by principles not present \nbefore, I shall identify first the occasions on which such emergence \n' \ntakes place,'\u00b7 and identify morphegenetic regulation among them. \nInanimate nature is self contained, achieving nothing, relying \non nothing and hence, unerring. \nThis fact defines the innovation \nachieved by the emergence of life from the inanimate . \n.All living \nthings function, and a function necessarily has a result which it \nmay achieve or fail to achieve. \nThus processes that are expected \nto achieve something have a value and such value is inexplicable \nin terms of processes having no value, \nThe logical impossibility of \nsuch an explanation may be affiliated to Hume's dictum that nothing \nthat ought to be, can be determined by knowing what is. \nWe may \nconclude that a principle not noticeably present in the inanimate \nmust come into operation when the inanimate brings forth living \nthings. \nDut the hierarchic structure of the higher forms of life neces-\nsitates the assumption of further processes of emergence, \nIf each ,, \nhigher level is to control the borderline left open by the opera-\ntions of the next lower level, this implies that these borderline \nconditions are in fact left open by the operations going on at the \nlower level. \nIn other words, no level can gain control over its own \nborderline conditions and hence cannot bring into existence a higher \n\n, . \n17 \nlevel, the operations of which consist precisely in controlling \nthese borderline conditions. \nThe logical structure of the hierarchy \nimplies that a higher level can come into existence only by a pro-\ncess not manifest in the lower level, a process whicl'vthus qualifies \n\u00b7\u00b7,2\u00b7:r\u20221:;{\u2022 i.' \nas an \"emergence. \n.\\~~ti' \nOur understanding of this relationship can be deepen~d by con-\nsidering its mental counterpart. \nTo the combination of organismic \n' \nand mechanical principles there corresponds in the mental field the \ncombination of tacit comprehension with a set of fixed logical opera-\ntions. \nA child starts off with a scanty repertoire of' innate mental \nconnections and enriches them rapidly by using his powers of compre-\nhension for establishing further f'\u00b7ixed.relations of experience. \nPiaget has described h01\u00b71 a child I s powe~s. of reasoning are _improved \nby developing increasingly stable rules of logical procedure. \nThis \ndevelopment is stimulated by the interiorisation of language and of' \nits verbal culture. \nIn this process the growing mind re-creates for \nitself the conceptual framework and the rules of reasoning bequeathed \nto it by its culture. \nEach of these fixations reduces the conceiv-\nable range of creative \u00b7innovations, but at the same time increases \ntheir power, by placing new tools at their disposal. \nThis works \nlike the anatomical differentiation of a developing organism, which \nnarrows down its areas of equipotentiality, while offering in ex-\nchange the use of a more powerful biotic machinery. \nWe must have then two kinds of principles present in living \nbeings that are not observable in inanimate nature. \nWe have the \nprinciples Cl\\rrently running the hierarchic machinery of life, by \ncontrolling the margin left open by a principle below them, and \n\n, . \n18 \ncontrolling ultimately the margin of physics and chemistry. \nAnd \nwe must have a principle that supplies the innovating power for \nbringing these controlling principles into existence. \nThey must be \npresent in the growth\u00b7 of the germ cell into a mature,;i:i_~gal:'lism, where \n.. q\"'~\u2022--d \nthey are recognised here as morphogenetic regulation, .-~n,d .. t)3ey must \n. \n,:~\\~..;,.l ~ \nbe present also in the process. of organic evolution by which higher \nforms of life have been brought forth from specks of protoplasm, as \nthey were pr'~sent before, in the event, whlch first brought life \ninto existence. \nHaving drawn an analogy, amounting to kinship, between embryonic \nmaturation and the intellectual development of the child, I clearly \nintend to claim now a kinship between the innovating powers of \nevolution and the powers of discovery \u00b71n science and technology. I \nshall indeed do so, as Henri Dergson has done before. \nI had this \nin mind already in my last lecture, when I spoke of supreme original-\nity in science as a self transformation, achieving new. levels of \nexistence. \nDy this definition, originality coincides with emergence, \nas I defined it today. \nIn order to re-consider the process of organic evolution in \nthis sense, we must start by restoring the problem from its misrepre-\nsentation by the current theory of evolution. \nIn my view, which I \nshall vindicate as I go along, the principal problem of evolution \n<' \nlies in the rise of higher beings from lower ones and, principally~ \nin the rise of man. \nA theory which recognises only evolutionary \nchanges due to the selective advantage of random mutations cannot \nacknowledge this problem. \nFor the capacity to survive is no cri-\nterion of evolutionary achievement in my sense. \nThere exist today \n\n, . \n19 \nanimals and plants on every evolutionary level. \nThe lower species \nhave of course survived up to date much longer than the higher ones \nand so their proven powers of survival are the greater. \nDut even \nif it could be shown that, for some reason, life at a:~h:tgl)er level \n'. \n. \u00b7\u00b7\u2022--.:\u2022 \n. ;\" \n! .. :;-~ : ~ \nsucceeds better in surviving than at a lower level, this .111,0:tf):d not \na\u2022_.,,-;-..._ l \nexplain how higher forms of life have come into existence, .. any more \nthan the fact that living things emerging from the inanimate have \ncontinued to live, explains the origin of life, \nThe current theory \nof evolution could explain as easily--indeed more easily--the \ndescent of the amoeba from man, as the actual rise of man from \ncreatures like the amoeba. \nHence it is not dealing with evolution \nat all. It is the height of intellectual perversion to renounce, \nin the name of scientific objectivity, our position as the highest \nform of life, which makes our ovm advent here by \u00b7a process of \n' \nevolution the central problem of evolution. \nThe representation of evolution; as due to differential selec-\ntive advantage, has been assisted by shifting attention from evolu-\ntion to the origin of species. \nA preoccupation with the way popula-. \ntions of a new kind come into existence has made us lose sight of \nthe more fundamental question, how any single individual of a higher \nspecies ever came into existence. \nI shall bring this problem into \nfocus by surveying the historical antecedents of any single indi-\nvidual of a higher form. \nThe origins of one man can be envisaged by tracing the mari 1s \nfamily tree all the way back to the primeval specks of protoplasm \nin which his first origins have lain. \nThe history of this family \ntree includes everything that has contributed to the making of this \n\n20 \nhuman being. \nThis segment of evolution is precisely on a par with \nthe history of a fertilized egg developing into a mature man, or \nthe history of a single plant growing from seed, which includes \neverything that caused that man, or that plant, to cQl'n!?;JJ};::o \n.. :\" \n~;'\" \nexistence. \nNatural selection plays no part in the evol~\\\\q~ of a \nsingle human being. \nWe do not include in the mechanism of growth \nthe possible adversities which d:l.d hot befall it and hence did not \n\u2022 \nprevent it. '-- The same holds for the evolution of a single human \nbeing; noth:1.ng is gained for understanding this evolution, by con-\nsidering the adverse chances which might nave prevented it. \nThe distinction between the origin of species and the evolu-\ntionary origin of a single individual, is logically sharp, \nTo \nrepresent changes in population as equivalent to the coming into \nexistence of their members, is like sayirig that you catch a tiger \nby catching two and letting one go. It might help to keep the two \nconceptions apart if we coin a new name for the process by which we \nmay call it an ideogenesis as distinct from a phylogenesis. \nThe study of ideogenesis does not disregard the occurrence of \naccidental mutations which may prove adaptive. \nIt merely assumes \nthat these can be distinguished from changes of type achieving new \nlevels of existence. \nMost palaeozoists i1ould agree that, though \nthis distinction is often difficult, it is none the less valid. And -\nonce this obvious distinction is allowed for, the thrust of evolu-\ntionary rise is as clearly manifest, as the growth of an individual \nfrom a germ cell. \nIt is widely accepted today that philosophy must leave the \nstudy of nature strictly to science. \nI must explain why I am offend-\n\n21 \ning against this injunction. \nI am doing this simply in the interest \nof truth, and I expect that scientists will see my point. \nFor I \ndo not think that they believe that what they say in these matters \nis true. \nFor example, when the great Lashley (1948).Jna,de the absurd \n' ~~ ... -~~ ~.,~:4 \nstatement that all mental processes must be ultimatery eb[pl.a.ined by \n. \n,:~~;~~t ~ \nphysics and chemistry, his purpose was merely to exclude\u00b7any sugges-\ntions that we should explain mental processes by an infringement of \nthe laws of\\inanimate matter in the nervous system. \nOther such \nstatements, even more obviously absurd, made byO. Hebb, (1954) \nclearly show this pragmatic intention. \nSince he sur\u00b7ely did not \nwant neurophysiologists to assume that all their subjects are uncon-\nscious, he can have meant this admoni~ion only as a guide to the \ntheoretical interpretation of neurological findings. \nThis is ap-\nparent from an account of the situation given by the psychiatrist \nL. S, Kubie on the very occasion when Hebb spoke in the terms I \nhave quoted. \nKubie said he regarded consciousness as an indispensa-\nble \u2022working concept' for psychology and went on to say \"Sometimes \nwe are explicit and frank about this. \nSometimes we fool ourselves \nabout it. Many workers have attempted to avoid using the ~,ord \nbecause of its traditional connotations . \nII \nThe practice of such deliberate ambiguities is rreely admitted \nin biology. \nEveryone knows that you cannot enquire into the func-\ntions of living organisms without referring to the purpose served\u00b7 \nby them and by the organs and processes that belong to them. \nYet we \nmust pretend that all such teleological explanations are merely \nprovisional. \nThe story goes round among biologists everyNhere that \nteleology is a woman of easy virtue, whom the biologist disowns in \n\n22 \npublic, but lives with in private. \nThe steady rise of higher organisms from lower ones, from which \nthis digression started, is also a case in point. \nTeilhard de Chardin P. D. Medawar reproved him for \nIn an article on \n\u00b7!\\a\u2022?~.:.:.., ... \nsuggem-:ing that \nl \n' \n- ~ :, \n\"evolution has a main track and privileged axis\", yet inYt+ie same \narticle Medawar offers his own explanation for this very fact. \nScientists may be right in recommending, and indeed enforcing, \ncertain basic assumptions that are obviously false. \nThe assumption \nthat man is an insentient automation, which no one can believe to \nbe true, has kept neurophysiology on the track of many beautiful \ndiscoveries, which perhaps could not have been made otherwise. \nDut \nthese technical fictions are not binding on the outsider. \nHowever \nwidely the working assumptions of science may lead to ever new dis-\ncoveries, we must not allow them to falsify the image of man and \nthe universe and depriving it of all meaning. \nAnd if science, for very good reasons, cannot undertake the \ntask of giving us a reasonable view of the universe, we must take \nthe matter into our own hands, in which scientists should help us, \nas ordinary people, outside the laboratory. \nOrdinary people have \nanticipated in many fundamental respects the knowledge on which \nbiology is based. \nAnimals and plants were recognised before zoology \nand botany; health and sickness before pathology; the contrast be-.,~ \ntween sentience and insentience, between intelligence and its absence, \nwere known before they were studied by science. \nThese were common \nknowledge, and so were many details of living functions, lil,e hunger \nfor food, need for breath, the processes of digestion, elimination \nand secretion, the functions of our senses, the process of procrea-\n\n, . \n23 \ntion, of embryological development, of growth and maturation, of \nsenescence. \nOne could go on without end enumerating the subjects \nwhich biologists took over from popular knowledge. \nI want us, ordinary men, to exercise once more our basic inter-\n-\u00b7 \n. \n-~ \\?.:..;:. _:;.-~:,; \npretative powers, for establishing a basic understanding'\":of the \n., \n'.,., \nevolution by which man has come into existence. \n':!!:\u00b5;~ t ~ \nThe principle we must apply is the same as that by which we \nsee the fingers of our hand and by which Copernicus saw the earth \n\u2022,. \ncircling the sun. It is the principle underlying the mental life \nof both animals and men, which tells us that things that hang to-\ngether are real and significant and that all such coherence presents \na problem, for what hangs together in one way is lilrnly to hang \ntogether also in other ways, yet to be\u2022.,discovered in the future. \nThe rise of man, of any single human being from inanimate begin-\nnings is such a massively coherent fact, unrivalled 'in the number \nand distinctiveness o~ the relations composing it. To see this \nimage, free of the false clues of selec_!;ionism, is to recognise that \nwe are facing a constructive power of the universe that has culmi-\nnated, so far, in bringing ourselves into existence. \nThe Copernican image of celestial motions evoked the theory of \nuniversal gi;'avitation which accounted for the central position of \nthe sun. \nEvolution, conceived as ideogenesis, recognises man as \nthe peak of creation, as the Dible had done in the language of \n\u00b7religion. \nOf the universal principles under which this achievement \nhas taken place, we can discern some already in outline. \nOne is the stratified structure of living things, which makes \nideogenesis a process of radical innovation; another is the princj_ple \n\n, .. \n24 \nwhich identifies the emergence of new levels of existence with the \nheuristic powers of tacit knowing. \nA further principle, which will \nlink emergence with the responsible choices made in an act of crea-\ntive thought, will be outlined in my next le_cture. \n\u00b7:j:~-~.;.:~,..;.~4 \nl.-have not hesitated to value the more comprehensiv&'\"'l.evels of \n).1)' ~.\\:-' \n'----~-,;., t\" \nlife as the higher forms of existence, for the absence of: .value judg-\nments in science is but a pretence, which, if followed strictly, \nwould render. biology blind not only to evolution, but to life itself. \nFor the value of life comes into existence with life itself. \nDut while there is a gradual intensification of value through-\nout the evolution of man, the emergence of these values is accom-\npanied at every step by an additional liability to miscarry. \nThe \ncapacity for growth, by which living things acquire their typical \nshapes, may produce malformations; physio_logical functions are sub-\nject to disabling and eventually mortal diseases; perception, drive \nsatisfaction, and learning, bring with them new failings by falling \ninto error; and finally, man is found not. only liable to a far \ngreater range of errors than animals are, but by virtue of his \nmoral sense, becomes c~pable also of evil. \nThis parallel development of capabilities and liabilities is \naccompanied by a consolidation of. the center to which these are \nattributable. \nLife exists predominantly in the form of individuals. \nnut at the vegetative level, as we have in plants, individuality i<f \nstill weak. \nThe center of the individual becomes more pronounced \nwith the rise of animal activities, and it grows more marked still \nin the exercise of intelligence. It rises to the level of person-\nhood in man. \nAnd again, every additional function with which the \n\ncenter is credited, exposes it to new reproaches, in respect of \nnew failures. \n25 \nThus, each new branch of biology that was developed to cover \nthe increasingly complex function of higher animals sets up addi-\n\u00b7r f?~~,;.\u00b7~\u2022~=\u2022 \ntional,- standards, to which the observer expects the anima-r t\u00b7o come \n':f~i~ }:~' \nup. \nAnd this intensification of criticism coincides with'an in-\ncreasing enrichment of relations between the critic and his object. \nHe know an animal, as we know a person, by entering into its per-\nformance and we appreciate it as an individual, in the interests \nof which these performances have their meaning. \nEven at the lowest, \npurely vegetative, level, we accept the interests of the animal as \nthe standard by which our own interest in the animal is justified. \nAll biology is, in this sense, convivia1. \nDut this conviviality \nrises to emotional concern as the animal approaches the human level. \nWe then become aware of its sentience, of its intelli'gence, and \nabove all of its emotional relations to ourselves. \nYet, however greatly we may love an animal, there is a reeling, \nwhich no animal can deserve, yet is commonly given to our fellowmen. \nI have said that at the, highest level of manhood, we meet man 1s \nmoral sense, guided by the firmament of his standards. \nEven when \nthis appears absent, its mere possibility is sufficient to evol,e our \nrespect. \nWe have here a fact that casts a new major task on the process,. \nof evolution; a task which appears the more formidable as we realise \nthat both this moral sense and our respect for it, presuppose an \nobedience to commands accepted in defiance to the immemorial scheme \nof self-preservation, dominating the evolutionary process up to this \npoint. \n\n26 \nYet evolution must make sense also of this afterthought to five \nhundred million years of pure self-seeking. \nAnd in a way this prob-\nlem can be put in biological terms. \nlror this potentiality for \nobedience to higher demands is largely involved in man 1s capacity \nfor anc::>ther peculiarly human relation to other men, ~1\\i1il,t& ,the \n. \n. \n~ \n..... \n:. \ncapacity to feel reverence for men greater than himself/ft'i evolu-\n.. \u00b7~ . \ntion is to include the rise of man, with all his sense of'higher \nobligations,, it must include also the rise of human greatness. \nIn my last lecture I shall expand the panorama of a universe \nthat I have sketched out so far, to include man's cultural equipment \nand this should offer us a frameworl{ within which we can define \nresponsible human action, of which man's moral decisions form but \na particular instance.",

    "content_html": "<p>FOR PRIV[;TE CIRCULATION ONLY Thought in Society by Michael Polanyi (As delivered on March 9, 1964 at Duke University) My first three lectures dealt with our power of tacit knowing. &#x27; \u00b7:\\?::.;.:~ .. ~:, They sh,owed that tacit knowing achieves comprehension l)y indwelling, , :!--:~~rt and that all knowledge consists, or iB- rooted, in such acts. of com- prehension. The f&#x27;ourth lecture showed how the structure of tacit knowing is duplicated in the structure of comprehensive entities . .. Dy studying the way tacit knowing comprehends human perf&#x27;ormances, I saw that what is comprehended bas the same structure as the act that comprehends it. The relation of a comprehensive entity to its par- ticulars was then generally recognised as the relation between two levels of reality, the higher one controlling the marginal conditions left indeterminate by the principles governing the lower one. Such levels could be stacked on top of each other to form a hierarchy, and this opened up the panorama of&#x27; a stratified universe of living beings. Stratification offered a framework for defining emergence as the action which produces a higher level, f&#x27;irst f&#x27;rom the inanimate to the living and then ~rom each biotic level to the one above it. Emergence would operate in this way both in the development of an individual and in the evolution of. living things. Tacit knowing was thus generalised to include emergence, and became the universal agency of fundamental innovations, an agency which, with rise of man, takes on the f&#x27;orm of originality in man. So in the end vie were confronted again with the mind of&#x27; man, mal{ing ever new sense of the world by dwelling in its particulars with a view to their comprehension, We now enter a new range of subjects, We shall ask, whether</p>\n<p>2 intellectual powers grounded in tacit knowing and affiliated to evolutionary emergence, can exercise the kind of responsible judg- ment which we must claim if we are to attribute a moral sense to man. Could, in fact, my critique of detachment, as ah;~xdeal of . . . \u00b7. ~\u00b7, . \u00b7;-~!~ t .r science, open the way towards a theory reestablishing tl}~u.t\\:);eoreti- ... \u00b7~ ~ ...... cal grounds of moral choice? The story has often been told how scientific rationalism has impaired moral beliefs, first by shattering their religious sanc- tions and then by questioning their logical grounds; but this can hardly explain the actual state of the modern mind, It is true that the Enlightenment y1eakened \u00b7ecclesiastic author- ity and that a modern mechanistic philo&lt;i&#x27;bphy--going back to La Mettrie--has denied justification to moral values. nut I do not think that the discredit which the ideal of detached scientific knowledge had cast on tne grounds of moral convictions, would by itself have done much damage to them, The self destructive tenden- cies of the modern mind arose only when the new scientific scepti- cism was combined with a new, unprecedented moral fervour. The social aspirations of modern man had their origins in Christianity, but they were actual\u00b7ly evoked by an attack on Chris- tianity, It was only when the philosophy of Enlightment had weak- ened the intellectual authority of the Christian churches, that Christian aspirations spilled over into the secular thoughts of men, _,, and intensified men 1s moral demands on society, The break~ng of ecclesiastical control may have proved morally damaging in the long run, but its primary effect was to arouse a new social conscience.</p>\n<p>3 At first, scientific scepticism smoothly cooperated with the new passions for social betterment. Dattling for freedom of thought against established authority, scepticism cleared the way for politi- cal freedom and humanitarian I&#x27;eforms. Scientific ratlqri._~lism in- . &lt;r\u00b7::\u2022~\u00b7\u2022 ., &quot;.~ \u00b7_, spired social and moral changes that have improved almost ,i;,,&#x27;,/ry . ,:~&quot;&#x27;;f~i.~ human relationship in western civilisation. Since the Prei\u00b0nch Revolu- tion, and up to our own days, this rationalism has been the chief guide towards &#x27;intellectual, moral and social progress. Where then is the fateful conflict between the moral scepticism of science and the unprecedented moral demands of modern man? Through- out the very period during which they were beneficiently combined, we can trace the undercurrent of their-menacing contradiction. llnd since the turn of the last century, the ~ixture of moral scepticism and moral perfectionism has become explosive. All that is peculiar to our age, its self-doubt, its audacity and its doctrinaire bigotry, originates in this mixture of opposites. Twentieth century mentality is a hybrid of scepticism and perfectionism. Such hybrids fall into two classes, one personal, the other political. The personal hybrid is born, when scepticism, looking at the world in strict detachment, finds fn it no grounds for authority or value--and declares man&#x27;s choice unrestricted, Then, moral perfec- tionism enters the scene and directs moral scepticism against the existing society, denouncing its morality as shoddy, artificial,\u00b7 ideological, hypocritical, a mere mask of exploitation. Thus moral scepticism and moral perfectionism combine to discredit all explicit expressions of morality, and, having blocked the proper channels of</p>\n<p>\u2022,)&#x27; .,. morality, they force moral passions to express themselves in anti- moralism. This situation was described already in Diderot 1s Neveu de Rameau two centuries ago. ( It was re_cently success in Paris.) Soon after this we find staged wi&#x27;tifi:i)Qflular . . -,;\u00b7 ~..;..;~ : &#x27; . &#x27;&#x27; ;, the Marquis det.Sade, . &#x27;.\u2022. claiming moral justification for unbridled lust and cruelty. (He has been recognised by French existentialists as their precursor.) &#x27; A century ago&#x27;\u00b7\u00b7nostojevski first described murder as an experiment in moral scepticism; and half a century has passed since Andre Gide showed that perversion and gratuitous crime could be seen as marks of moral authenticity. Today we have a whole literature, in Which a somber and fantastic obscenity is\u00b7 presented as a token of ulti- mate honesty. This has been a powerful movement pervading our whole culture. &quot;Man must be his own beginning: the author of all his values&quot;. This teaching of Sartre was already anticipated by the manifestoes of abstract art at the beginning of our century. They made the same demands for absolute authenticity through total self determination. The fusion of scepticism and perfectionism which produce such radical individualism, can also issue.in political teachings totally . . suppressing the individual. Marxist perfectionism, which demands the absolute humanisation of society, denounces in the same breath any appeal to moral ideas as futile and dishonest. It injects its moral demands instead into a theory postulating a mechanical course of history, which, serving as a scientific disguise of_its utopian promises demands unconditional support for its consummation, We are commanded to fight for a utopia, by the voice of science, which pro-</p>\n<p>5 tects us from our scepticism, by scorning all utopias. We are in- cited to absolute revolutionary self determination by an assurance that its outcome is strictly predictable, The historical role of Marxism Leninism, and its power, lies in thus unitir:tg;)the two con- \u2022 . -.~-&lt;&#x27;!&#x27;&quot; ..:;\u2022-/\u2022 .\u2022 tradictory forces of the modern mind into a single poiit,fc~l doc- ,::\u00b7.\u00b5;..;.: .. trine. Its fusion of total scepticism and total perfectionism has secured the loyalty of millions to the insane tyranny of Stalin, and this disaster was intrinsic to the modern mind. It engulfed some of the ablest and most generous among\u00b7us. * It may appear extravagant to hope that these self-destructive forces of the modern mind could b~ har~onized by reconsidering the way we know things. If I yet believe, that a basic reconsideration of knowledge may be effective today, it is beca4se, for some time past, a revulsion has been noticeable against the ideas which brought us to our present state. Doth inside and outside the Soviet Empire, men are getting weary of ideas qerived from the fusion of scientific scepticism and moral perfectionism, Suspicion is growing that something is fundamentally wrong here. This revisionist move- ment can be assisted by basing our thoughts on truer grounds, I have prepared for this effDrt in certain respects .. Everything I have said implied my repudiation of the grounds on which the ab- solute intellectual and moral self-determination of man was pro- claimed by the great philosophic movement which supplied ideas of the French Revolution. To acknowledge tacit thought as an indispen- sable element of all knowing and as the ultimate mental power by which all explicit knowledge is endo~ied with meaning, is to deny the</p>\n<p>\u2022,,, . &#x27; ,;j 6 possibility that each succeeding generation, let alone each member of it, should critically test all the teachings in which we are brought up. Statements explicitly derived from identifiable premises can be critically tested by examing their premises, ancl:.tl;w process . _-, t..::&quot;&quot;!- : . , of inference which led to them. Dut, if we know a greati.@e:dl that . - \u00b7., ,:\u00b7-.. &#x27;. we cannot tell, and if even that which we know and can tell is ac- cepted by us as true only in view of its bearing on a reality beyond it, a reality: which can yet manifest itself in the future in an in- determinate range of unsuspected ways; if indeed we recognize a great discovery, a great idea, or else a great personality, as most real, owing to the wider range of their yet unknown future manifesta- tions; then the idea of knowledge based.on wholly identifiable -,~ grounds collapses, and we must conclude that the transmission of knowledge from one generation to the other must be predominantly tacit. I have spoken of the effort that a person receiving a message must make, in order to understand it. Higher learning and the arts and skills can be taught only to pupils eager to make a great effort to understand theiP teachers and imitate their skill. A tacit knowl- edge is a dwelling in our awareness -of particulars in terms of an entity they jointly constitute. 1n order to share this indwelling, the pupil must presume that a teaching which appears meaningless to .t&#x27; start with, has in fact a meaning which can be discovered by hitting on the same kind of indwelling as the teacher is practicing. Think of the amazing deployment of the infant mind. It is stirred on by a veritable blaze of confidence, surmising the hidden meaning of speech and other adult behaviour. And this holds for all</p>\n<p>7 subsequent stages of learning. Interiorisation can proceed only by accepting the particulars bearing on the ideas which they convey without attending to these particulars, We may never be able to identify any of the premises of a culture in which. we. are growing up, \u00b7:_v&#x27;.&quot; __ ,:. ~----~\u2022 any more than we will be able to tell what principles \\~e &#x27;ifrei tacitly &#x27; ,}J..:;_f: applying in using our senses: and our body. At each step\u00b7 ~le accept, and must accept, unidentifiable grounds, trusting that the practice based on them is sound and the ideas conveyed by them true. A scepticism which would avoid this would spell total imbecility. St. Augustine has observed this, when--basing himself on Scripture--he said: &quot;unless ye believe, ye shall not understand.&quot; It appears then that traditionalism, which requires us to believe before we know, and in order tha:t we may know, is based on a deeper insight into the nature of knowledge, than is a scientific rationalism, which would permit us to believe only explicit state- ments based on specific data and derived by a formal inference which we have previously tested. Dut I am not re-asserting traditionalism here for the purpose of supporting dogmatism. I admit that my re-affirmation of tradi- tionalism might have a bearing on religious teaching, but I want to set this aside here. For I believe that modern man\u2022s\u00b7critical lucid- ity must be reconciled with his unlimited moral demands, first of all, on secular grounds. We should hope to derive religious en- lightenment and perhaps a religious renewal from such a reconcilia- tion, rather than try to invol{e the authority of revealed religion for achieving this reconciliation, Neither am I going back on the impetus of the French Revolution.</p>\n<p>tt .... 8 I accept its dynamism, and share both its intellectual and its social aspirations. Dut I believe that the self-determination of man, proclaimed by the Enlightenment, can be saved from destroying itself only by recognising its own limits in an aut~ef:~:::ive tradi- tional, framework which upholds it. Tom Paine could proc&#x27;fa.i!ll the -!~ti: .. ~~ right of each generation to determine anew its political\\i~stitu- tions, for the range of this demand was in fact very limited. He unquestioningly accepted the traditional continuity of culture as &#x27;, the framework of self-determination. Today, the ideas of Tom Paine can be saved from self-destruction only by a conscious re-affirmation of cultural continuity. Tom Paine&#x27;s intentions can be upheld only by the kind of traditionalism pro~e~sed by Paine&#x27;s opponent, Edmund Durke. * I shall define this traditionalism by analysing the peculiar way in which the pursu:l,t of scientific discovery is organised. , Science is systematic; but, as a whole, it is not ordered ex- plicitly, like the systematic chart of the animal kingdom. Admit- tedly, science is divided into branches, and the branches are sub- divided into narrower subjects. Dut the advancement of any one part of science depends directly on the progress of many other parts, possibly any other part. So the system of science forms a complex network. Any major discovery may weave new strands into / this network, and may even reorganise it altogether. When Max von Laue discovered the diffraction of X-rays by crystals in 1912, crystallography was a dull subject, to be mugged up without a thought; fifty years later, it had become the center of an intel\u2022\u00b7 lectual empire 1\u00b7rith provinces in every part of science, .</p>\n<p>9 Milton has compared truth with a shattered statue, the scat- tered fragments of which have to be collected and fitted together. Dut when you put together the fragments of a statue, you can see gaps where parts are missing and can see roughly the &#x27;shap,e:.,_,,these . \u00b7~\u00b7, ?,..,::-: . , missing parts must have in order to fit into a particulan.i(gap. Not so in science. To the average student, the system of science is always complete. Its gaps are visible only to exceptional minds who can sense&#x27;\u00b7 the hidden possibilities to which present scientific knowledge offers clues. The heuristic vision of their subject and of its relations to other parts of science guides them to their problems and sets them on the path to discovery. This brings us to the curious \u00b7relation of an individual scien- tist to the system of science. No single scientist knows more than a tiny part of science and his view of this fragment ~s highly per- sonal. How can we yet confidently speak of science as a systematic body of knowledge, and can we rely on it that science has the same scientific character throughout this body? The answer to this lies in a principle that, to my knowledge, has never yet been stated, even though it is commonly practised in various fields. I would call it the _Principle of Overlapping Neigh- &#x27; borhoods. Every mature scientist knows an important part of science at first hand and can testify to its rich connections with other parts of science. This is as much as he can actually see of the system of science. Dut there are other scientists, cultivating ad- joining fields, who see a similar fragment of science, parts of which overlap with the area well known to the first scientist. Con- \u2022 sequently, when the first scientist finds that the judgments of his</p>\n<p>.. 10 neighbours about these overlapping areas is sound, he can take their word for it that science has systematic relations also in other I directions beyond the overlapping areas and that the entire domains of his neighbours have the same scientific character ?,Sc-l:lis o~m. &#x27; )----,y-\u2022t:,-_..,:, Such reliance is of course mutual, and extends. further \u00b7rr6~&#x27; tihe . ~:~~;~~-;~. first scientist&#x27;s neighbours in turn to their neighbours,\u00b7and so on indefinitely. Thus the whole of science, of which no one can know at first\\hand more than a tiny fragment, is covered by a net- work of overlapping neighbourhoods. Through this network every scientist participates in watching over the systematic coherence and scientific character of all science. It is by trusting the operations, .ot this network, and only by trusting it, that we can say that a systematic body of science exists. And when we say that science is a. public_. domain of knowl- edge, we mean that, in view of this network, any particular scien- tific statement may be deemed to be accredited at second hand by all other scientists; and that we might c.onceivably find one pre- pared to demonstrate its truth to our satisfaction. Though it must be admitted, that such demonstration would hardly convince us, but for the fact, that we would trust the scientist, because he is trusted by his fellows. The network of mutual surveillance v1hich secures the existence of a systematic body of knowledge to the satisfaction of its participants, imposes its acceptance on laymen, by virtue of the confidence granted by laymen. to the body of scien- tists as a whole, If, for any reason, a serious break should develo~ either in the internal network of science, or between it and the general public, the existence of science as a systematic body of</p>\n<p>+ I 11 public knowledge would be called in question. The situation is not without risks, for science is not a body of fixed knowledge, but an expanding enterprise.

Here we see an exercise of authority, based on tradition, coming fully into vie.w. I have mentioned in my first lecture how scientific opinion determines whether a contribution submitted to a scientific journal is sufficiently plausible to be taken seriously. The teachings of science convey at all times certain. basi.c convictions about the nature of things and about the method, whlch in consequence, is likely to yield results of scientific value. These beliefs and the art of scientific enquiry based on them, are not codified. In the main, they are tacitly implied in the traditional pursuit of scientific enquiry. They have undergone great changes in the course of the past four hundred years. Yet scientific opinion exercises at all times a powerful pressure to enforce these premises of scientific enquiry. Contributions which run counter to them are usually refused publication and, if published, are \u00b7ignored. Such selection is in- dispensable, if journals are not to be rendered useless by carrying floods of nonsense. Yet the practice is notoriously dangerous, as important work has sometimes been refused attention. It has also led to occasional crises of confidence between scientific opinion and the lay public, as in the Velikowski case, and it has happened-- though rarely--that in such a conflict, science was wrong and lay</p>\n<p>,,; 12 opinion was right. My own quarrel with scientific opinion is large- ly about its official philosophy, though I have shotm that there are considerable areas of some sciences the very substance of which has been warped by tal&lt;ing this false philosophy as its gui&#x27;de .\u2022.. Even so, . . \u00b7-\u2022~-=- .. i-!&quot;&lt; .\u2022 I am only conce,rned with the false and meaningless image:1-;f!,&#x27;the universe which these distortions of&#x27; science present. I believe that lay judgment has well tested grounds on which to oppose sc;l.entific opinion in such matters. Dut the fact that a statement is accepted to be true, does not yet qualify it to form part of&#x27; science. There are many true state- ments which, though very important, are not part of science. A true statement is deemed to form a\u00b7 substantial part of science in &quot; the light of its scientific value. This value is composed of. three coefficients: 1) its accuracy, 2) its importance for the system of science, 3) the ordinary, non-scientific interest of its subject ~ matter. The same scientific value may be compounded of these three variables in different proportions. For example, though inanimate matter, which is the subject of physics, is not very interesting in itself, physics makes up for this by the accuracy of its measurements and the beauty of its theories. On the other hand, the discoveries of biology, though often not quantifiable and hence devoid of any mathematical beauty, richly compensate for such deficiency by the great human interest of living beings, which are its subject matter. The proper assessment of scientific value is indispensable to the conduct of scientific life. It determines, whether a paper is worth publishing, and before that, it necessarily enters into assess- ing whether a problem is ~,orth pursuing. What is more, the distribu-</p>\n<p>.. 13 tion of funds between different lines of enquiry, indeed, between different branches of science, will essentially depend on the com- parative scientific value of the result to be expected in these alternative directions. Indeed the very opportunity for conducting \u00b7:.~?~~,;-::,ff;:, research as an independent scientist, will depend on ari assessment .\\it.:t::\u00b7 of the scientific value of the work that a candidate for -s:uch a position may be expected to produce. Not only do comparative judg- ments of scientific value determine thus the shape of science, but -.. they determine beyond that the very composition of the network of scientists, whose collective opinion will make these judgments of value. Not only is science what it is, owing to such judgments, but scientists are what they are, ~y, virtue of their mutual assess- ment of each other I s merits in the light-. of these values. Not a move can be made in scientific life without involving a most delicate and complex assessment of scientific vaiue. Any dis- agreement on these standards of value causes a serious strain in the fabric of scientific life and any profound disagreement would menace the very existence of science as a coherent system of knowl- edge. Remember now that these evaluations are exercised by a multitude of scientists, each of whom is competent to assess only a tiny frag- ment of current scientific work. Consider that each scientist must originally have established himself by joining at some point the net- work of mutual appreciation extending far beyond his own horizon. Each such acceptance appears then as a submission in advance to a vast range of value-judgments exercised over all the domains of science, which the newly accepted citizen of science henceforth en-</p>\n<p>dorses unseen. Thus the standards of scientific merit are seen to be transmitted from generation to generation by the affiliation of individuals at a great variety of widely disparate points, in the same way, as artistic, moral or legal traditions are transmitted. . \u00b7! \\1~::;;. . And we may conclude, that the appreciation of _scientific \u00b7v&#x27;.alue too Ji: i:-- is based on a tradition which succeeding generations accep:t;&#x27;.&#x27;and develop into their own scientific opinion. Dut thi~ is still only half the story of authority and tradi- tional values in the shaping of science. For scientific opinion appreciates yet another value and prizes it greatly, and this value is opposed to those that I have spol{en so far; it is the value of originality. Doth the criteria of plausibility and of accepted scientific value enforce conformity, whiie the value attached to originality encourages dissent. This internal tension is essential in guiding and motivating scientific work. The professional stand- ards of science must impose a framework of discipline and at the same time encourage rebellion against it. This is \\\u00b71hy science can pride itself both on its discipline and its revolutionary daring. The authority of scientific tradition enforces the teachings of science in general for the very purpose of fostering their subver- sion in the particular. Scientific tradition derives this curious capacity for evoking opposition to itself and readily assimilating it from its belief in.,\u00b7 the presence of a hidden reality, of v1hich the established teachings of science represent only one aspect: of a reality that is yet to be revealed more fully by future discoveries. It teaches its ortho- doxy to the novice as a guide to malrn his Olm contact with reality</p>\n<p>15 by which he shall gain independent grounds to oppose this orthodoxy. Each independent discovery, born into the existing system of science, safeguards its coherence, even though by its originality, it may profoundly modify the system and even affect the nature of \u00b7: )?.:,.;;. ~:;-li,_:4 its harmonies. Every generation is responsible for re.:interpreting . }JL::} f&#x27; the criteria of plausibility and the standards of scientific value and originality transmitted by the tradition of science. Such self- renewal of tradition is fateful, and yet unavoidable. To speak of science and of its continued future progress is to share the commit- ment of scientists and hope for their wisdom in serving it. Any attempt to replace this shared commitment by exhaustively specify- ing its grounds, must fail. Scientific authority is not distributed evenly throughout the body of scientists; some distinguished members of the profession &#x27; , predominate over others of a more junior standing. Dut the author- ity of scientific opinion remains essentially mutual; it is estab- lished reciprocally bet1\u00b71een scientists, n_ot above them. They exer- cise their authority over each other, Once the novice has reached the grade of a mature scientist, there is no longer any superior above him. The Republic of Science realises the ideal of Rousseau, of a community in which each is an equal partner in the General Will. Dut seen in this light, the General Will is seen to differ from any&lt;&#x27; other will in that it cannot alter its purpose. The community of scientists would instantly dissolve, if its task came to an end and the members of the community had to decide on doing something else. fl subjective choice can be varied at will, but a commitment rooted</p>\n<p>16 in tradition and bearing on reality, is dissolved by a change of direction. The difference is fur.damental. The Republic of Science, of which I described the constitution, is a Society of Explorers, bent on an to be accessible and worth achieving. be suited to explorations in the arts, indeterminate f.utll;I&#x27;e, believed . ~- \u00b7:_-&lt;&#x27;.?&#x27;&quot;&#x27; -~\u00b7~{\u2022 , A similar constitut1ou should &#x27;&#x27;.~~i~ i: in literature, in \u2022\\;iays of life, in religion, in politics. All these can advance only by in- dependent iniJiatives, mutually adjusted by taking note of each other. Such adjustments will include rivalries and conflicts, which, in society as a whole, are far more frequent than they are in scienc~ Even so, all the independent initiatives must accept for their guidance a traditional authority, enfor?ing its own self-renewal by cultivating originality among its forlowers. Elliot sars that &quot;often, the best, and indeed the most individual parts of a poet 1s work may be those in which the dead poets, his &#x27;---. ancestors, assert their immortality most vigorously.&quot; And of the scope of ancestral ideas he wrote in Little Gidding: And what the dead had no speech for, when living, They can tell you, being dead: the communication Of the dead is tongued with fire beyond the language of the living. We have seen that what Copernicus had no speech for when living, he could tell, being dead, to Kepler, Galileo and Newton. We may safely assume then that the powers of anticipation, in-,&gt; herent in tradj.tion, are alike in poetry and in science. Elizabeth Sewell has been demonstrating for some years past that poetry can actually anticipate scientific discovery. * It was the problems of the modern mind, which have led me to</p>\n<p>17 explore the traditional grounds of scientific discovery and to glance at similar grounds in other creative work throughout society. We can see now that the absolute intellectual, moral and political self-determination implied in the teachings of scientit,i;q rational- . . -\u2022.\u2022 ~~-4 . ~_;.; ;: , ism, is absurd. And we can see that the doctrine, going:,RB-~k to - -. &#x27;; ;-... &#x27;\u00b7 . \u00b7. Descartes and supported by great thinkers like Kant, J. s~ Mill and Dertrand Russell, which teaches that radical doubt leaves behind unchallengeab-le truth, and that we must critically examine any affirmation or supposition transmitted to us, before accepting it, is equally untenable. Our mind comes into existence only by vora- ciously accepting innumerable unexamined premises, without which we would grow up as total idiots. It\u00b7is not true that science flour- ishes by the practice of absolute scepticism. On the contrary, it is based on an elaborate tradition of plausibilities, intellectual values and assessments of originality, which scientists maintain . &#x27; within an organisation of mutual trust and mutual appraisal. Scien- tific originality arises within this matrix and has no meaning with- out it. I see creative thought encouraged on similar lines throughout modern society. It is organised like scientific life by the mutual adjustment of-independent initiatives guided by an authority recip- rocally imposed on each other by its members. It is a Society of Explorers, teaching its dynamic tradition, which constantly renews itself by fostering originality. These creative innovations are personal--intensely personal--acts, but their intent is universal, for they are dictated by a compelling responsibility for advancing true thought and noble actions. Wherever men have rightly spoken</p>\n<p>18 in the name of truth, saying, Here I stand and cannot do otherwise, we instantly recognise both the power of impersonal truth and the greatness of the mind upholding it. We readily identify both the personal and the universal pole of such a commitment. \u2022f ;2?..:.;.:.... . Whether we date it to Luther or to Copernicus, or-tci~~tne French -!-Ii: &#x27;; :\u00b7 Revolution, our heritage is this Society of Explorers, o:e\u00b7:which I have traced the constitution and defined the metaphysical founda- tions. The freedom and responsibility of modern man is guaranteed by this framework and circumscribed by it. Originality is always fragmentary, The degree of originality any particular scientist trusts himself to possess will decide the range of matters over which he will venture to improve on current teachings, and by the same decision he will accept unquestioningly an immensely greater range of teachings as the basis of his new departure. Such is the definition of his particular calling. And just as each scientist must choose a problem, \u00b7which is neither too large for him to solve, nor too small to be worth his while--so a great reformer may call in question a large province of existing society, if he feels equal to the task of improving it, while others will take the responsi-- bility for the betterment of a smaller area of society--perhaps an imperceptibly small one. The degr:ee \u00b7to which existing society is accepted as given will vary between greater men and lesser men, but what is accepted as given must always remain predominant. It follows, that scepticism is an unreliable instrument for the enlargement of freedom; it exercises a liberating power only when incidental to creative originality. Perfectionism is destructive; the great movements of reform which have so deeply improved society</p>\n<p>19 in the Western parts of the world since the French Revolution, were achieved by abandoning the perfect:).onism of that revolution. When,. in our own twentieth century, radical scepticism was combined with revolutionary perfectionism, there ensued a period of&#x27;,0Ut\\P,:i;&#x27;._E~cedented . .. ~:-&#x27;-: : \u00b7&quot; cultural destruction, of paranoiac mendacity and, enslave_lll~~ji&quot;. : &#x27;.\u2022 I must turn now to the personal form taken on by the :.hybridisa- tion of moral scepticism and perfectionism, so widespread in our times. What&#x27;-..shall we say of writers from Nietzsche to Sartre who tell us that man must be his own beginning, the author of his own values? To explore these doctrines in the imagination, has served as a theme for great literature and its extreme demands of original- ity have quickened our sensibility\u00b7to the basic elements of art, be \u00b7-. it in poetry, fiction or drama, painting or sculpture, or music. They have impelled philosophy to daring explorations of being and nothingness. Dut it is not surprising that any tendency to apply these doctrines in practice, has been disastrous. For they are, of course, absurd. * Dut we must not leave unnoticed the deter\u00b7minist objectjons to the claims of personal responsibility. Philosophers since Kant have found it difficult to find a place for man&#x27;s responsible deci- sions in the natural order of things. Can a conception of responsi- - / bility ultimately grounded in my own commitment to its metaphysical fo\u2022lr,rlations, withstand the critique of universal causation? I should reply that this critique has lost much of&#x27; lts severity for two reasons. The first is, that we can be sure tha.t. th&lt;&gt; t\u2022r1.n(,1 - ples g&lt;,v&lt;,-:t:&quot;frlng \u00b7\\.n:).n1rr.n.r,o nn.t-.ur.~ do m,t &lt;let&lt;Yl&#x27;.&#x27;m1ne the bet,avior of</p>\n<p>20 different from all that is noticeable in the inanimate domain of nature, to account for sentient a.n!i r-e-aponsible human behaviour. Secondly, even in the inanimate domain, we have come to acknowl- edge the occurrence of uncaused events. decompose today, the other in a thousand on it that there is absolutely no reason One radio-active atom may \u00b7! _\\---:._,;. _:,,.,.J. years, and phys:i:\u00b0b&#x27;s\\insists ,\\~~t: for this difference, I shall not suggest (as some writers have) that responsible decisions operate uncaused by virtue of quantum mechanical indeterminacy. Chance events and the responsible choices of men have it in common that in both cases we feel that the outcome could have been other than that which has actually happened; but otherwise no two things could be more different. The outc.ome ()f a chance event is the most meaningless thing in the world; a\u00b7fesponsible choice the most significant utterance of a rational being: it owes nothing to chance. I shall borrow from physics only the revolutionary possi- bility of assuming uncaused events to take place under those princi- ples which might account for the characteristic behaviour of sentien1; responsible beings. Physicists will remember that for a quarter of a century, from the discovery of quanta by Planck in 1900, to the discovery of quantum mechanics in 1925, there were two kinds of physics, classi- cal physics for large particles, and quantum physics for atoms. Some physicists, including Niels Dohr, tried to link the two domains by\u00b7 a transitional principle which would yield the two different sys- tems of physics as the two solutions appropriate for large and small particles, respectively, When quantum mechanics was \u00b7discovered, it offered just such a principle. We are facing a similar situation and, with luck, may mal&lt;e as</p>\n<p>21 ,- good a guess at a future solution. At one end we have the domain of inanimate nature, at the other, the highest form of life repre- sented by a creative \\ will account for the a transition between act of the mind, The missing principle which emergence of man from the inanimate, must form the two domains. Look first at inanimate nature. It is controlled by forces which draw matter towards stabler configurations. These forces may be held in check by friction, which can be released by various agent~ some of them uncaused. The decomposition of a radioactive atom may be the uncaused cause of an explosion. To sum up: we see forces driving towards stabler potentialities, which, when locked by fric- tion, can be released by uncaused events controlled only by probabil- ities. Creative innovations are evoked likewise by an\u00b7anticipation of their hidden potentiality. In the inanimate domain the accessibility of a stabler position produces a force, in the mind it produces a problem. This heuristic tension is released by choices, that are hazardous and appear uncaused. Dut such gropings are not random; they are not controlled by statistical probability but by a heuristic effort, seeking the truth. The great difference is that the mind produces something new, a new comprehension controlled by a new level of existence which the inanimate does not do, We may surmise then that the quality of con- sciousness resides, that is absent in the inanimate. In my last lecture I identified emergence, which creates new levels of existence, with comprehension by tacit knowing. Such organic innovations should now be regarded as due to the release of</p>\n<p>22 ( potentialities by the gropings of uncaused events. I have spoken of the gradual intensification of the center in living things, ac- companied by an increasing value of its actions and exposing it to ever more serious reproaches, This process, culminating in the greatness and misery of moral responsibility, would have its place here, at the very point where consciousness arises to grant us the capacity for facing responsibility. * The over-all title I gave to these lectures was &quot;Man in Thought&#x27;; I wanted to speak of the logical interrelation between living and thinking in man and to extend this interrelation by tracing the joint ancestry of man and thought, all the way back to their inani- mate antecedents. I have introduced a number of new principles, ( crowded on top of each other, for I could not resist the temptation of glancing at a set of ideas appearing on the horizon. Dut I feel that, actually, all I have tallrnd about presents a single, fairly simple vision. This part of the universe, in which man has arisen, seems to be filled with a field of potentialities which evoke action. The action thus evoked in inanimate matter is rather poor, perhaps quite meaningless. Dut inanimate matter, matter that is both lifeless and deathless, takes on a new meaning by originating living things. With them a hazard enters the hitherto unerring universe: the hazard of life and death. The field of new potential meanings opened up was so rich that this enterprise swept on towards an infinite range of higher meanings, unceasingly pouring them into existence, for the better part of a billion years. Almost from the start this evolutionary response to potential meaning had</p>\n<p>23 \\ 1 its counterpart in the behaviour of the living things it brought forth. It seems that even protozoa have the faculty of learning; they respond to potential meaning. Rising stages of evolution pro- duce more meaningful organisms, capable of ever more complex feats of understanding. In the last few thousand years we, men, have enormously increased the range of comprehension by equipping our tacit powers \\&#x27;/ith an explicit cultural machinery of language and writing. Immersed in this cultural milieu we n01., respond to a vastly increased range of potential thought. It is the image of humanity immeFsed in potential thought that I find revealing in its bearing on the problems of our day. It rids us of the absurdity of absolute self-determination, yet offers ,--;,\\ each of us the chance of creative originality, within the fragmentary &#x27;- , \\ area which circumscribes our calling. It provides us with the \u00b7meta- ,.,,\u00be physical grounds and the organising principle of a Society of Ex- plorers and I believe that this represents the essence of a modern free society.

The relation of a comprehensive entity to its par-\nticulars was then generally recognised as the relation between two \nlevels of reality, the higher one controlling the marginal conditions \nleft indeterminate by the principles governing the lower one. \nSuch \nlevels could be stacked on top of each other to form a hierarchy, \nand this opened up the panorama of' a stratified universe of living \nbeings. \nStratification offered a framework for defining emergence \nas the action which produces a higher level, f'irst f'rom the inanimate \nto the living and then ~rom each biotic level to the one above it. \nEmergence would operate in this way both in the development of an \nindividual and in the evolution of. living things. \nTacit knowing was thus generalised to include emergence, and \nbecame the universal agency of fundamental innovations, an agency \nwhich, with rise of man, takes on the f'orm of originality in man. \nSo in the end vie were confronted again with the mind of' man, mal{ing \never new sense of the world by dwelling in its particulars with a \nview to their comprehension, \nWe now enter a new range of subjects, \nWe shall ask, whether \n\n2 \nintellectual powers grounded in tacit knowing and affiliated to \nevolutionary emergence, can exercise the kind of responsible judg-\nment which we must claim if we are to attribute a moral sense to \nman. \nCould, in fact, my critique of detachment, as ah;~xdeal of \n. \n. \n. \n\u00b7. ~\u00b7, . \u00b7;-~!~ t .r \nscience, open the way towards a theory reestablishing tl}~u.t\\:);eoreti-\n... \u00b7~ ~ ...... \ncal grounds of moral choice? \nThe story has often been told how scientific rationalism has \nimpaired moral beliefs, first by shattering their religious sanc-\ntions and then by questioning their logical grounds; but this can \nhardly explain the actual state of the modern mind, \nIt is true that the Enlightenment y1eakened \u00b7ecclesiastic author-\nity and that a modern mechanistic philo<i'bphy--going back to La \nMettrie--has denied justification to moral values. \nnut I do not \nthink that the discredit which the ideal of detached scientific \nknowledge had cast on tne grounds of moral convictions, would by \nitself have done much damage to them, \nThe self destructive tenden-\ncies of the modern mind arose only when the new scientific scepti-\ncism was combined with a new, unprecedented moral fervour. \nThe social aspirations of modern man had their origins in \nChristianity, but they were actual\u00b7ly evoked by an attack on Chris-\ntianity, It was only when the philosophy of Enlightment had weak-\nened the intellectual authority of the Christian churches, that \nChristian aspirations spilled over into the secular thoughts of men, \n_,, \nand intensified men 1s moral demands on society, \nThe break~ng of \necclesiastical control may have proved morally damaging in the long \nrun, but its primary effect was to arouse a new social conscience. \n\n3 \nAt first, scientific scepticism smoothly cooperated with the \nnew passions for social betterment. \nDattling for freedom of thought \nagainst established authority, scepticism cleared the way for politi-\ncal freedom and humanitarian I'eforms. \nScientific ratlqri._~lism in-\n. \n<r\u00b7::\u2022~\u00b7\u2022 \n., \n\".~ \u00b7_, \nspired social and moral changes that have improved almost ,i;,,',/ry \n. \n,:~\"';f~i.~ \nhuman relationship in western civilisation. \nSince the Prei\u00b0nch Revolu-\ntion, and up to our own days, this rationalism has been the chief \nguide towards 'intellectual, moral and social progress. \nWhere then is the fateful conflict between the moral scepticism \nof science and the unprecedented moral demands of modern man? Through-\nout the very period during which they were beneficiently combined, \nwe can trace the undercurrent of their-menacing contradiction. \nllnd \nsince the turn of the last century, the ~ixture of moral scepticism \nand moral perfectionism has become explosive. \nAll that is peculiar \nto our age, its self-doubt, its audacity and its doctrinaire bigotry, \noriginates in this mixture of opposites. \nTwentieth century mentality \nis a hybrid of scepticism and perfectionism. \nSuch hybrids fall into two classes, one personal, the other \npolitical. \nThe personal hybrid is born, when scepticism, looking at the \nworld in strict detachment, finds fn it no grounds for authority or \nvalue--and declares man's choice unrestricted, \nThen, moral perfec-\ntionism enters the scene and directs moral scepticism against the \nexisting society, denouncing its morality as shoddy, artificial,\u00b7 \nideological, hypocritical, a mere mask of exploitation. \nThus moral \nscepticism and moral perfectionism combine to discredit all explicit \nexpressions of morality, and, having blocked the proper channels of \n\n\u2022,)' \n.,. \nmorality, they force moral passions to express themselves in anti-\nmoralism. \nThis situation was described already in Diderot 1s Neveu de \nRameau two centuries ago. \n( It was re_cently \nsuccess in Paris.) \nSoon after this we find \nstaged wi'tifi:i)Qflular \n. \n. -,;\u00b7 \n~..;..;~ : ' \n. '' ;, \nthe Marquis det.Sade, \n. '.\u2022. \nclaiming moral justification for unbridled lust and cruelty. \n(He \nhas been recognised by French existentialists as their precursor.) \n' \nA century ago'\u00b7\u00b7nostojevski first described murder as an experiment \nin moral scepticism; and half a century has passed since Andre Gide \nshowed that perversion and gratuitous crime could be seen as marks \nof moral authenticity. \nToday we have a whole literature, in Which \na somber and fantastic obscenity is\u00b7 presented as a token of ulti-\nmate honesty. \nThis has been a powerful movement pervading our whole culture. \n\"Man must be his own beginning: \nthe author of all his values\". This \nteaching of Sartre was already anticipated by the manifestoes of \nabstract art at the beginning of our century. \nThey made the same \ndemands for absolute authenticity through total self determination. \nThe fusion of scepticism and perfectionism which produce such \nradical individualism, can also issue.in political teachings totally \n. \n. \nsuppressing the individual. \nMarxist perfectionism, which demands \nthe absolute humanisation of society, denounces in the same breath \nany appeal to moral ideas as futile and dishonest. It injects its \nmoral demands instead into a theory postulating a mechanical course \nof history, which, serving as a scientific disguise of_its utopian \npromises demands unconditional support for its consummation, \nWe are \ncommanded to fight for a utopia, by the voice of science, which pro-\n\n5 \ntects us from our scepticism, by scorning all utopias. \nWe are in-\ncited to absolute revolutionary self determination by an assurance \nthat its outcome is strictly predictable, \nThe historical role of \nMarxism Leninism, and its power, lies in thus unitir:tg;)the two con-\n\u2022 \n. \n-.~-<'!'\" ..:;\u2022-/\u2022 .\u2022 \ntradictory forces of the modern mind into a single poiit,fc~l doc-\n,::\u00b7.\u00b5;..;.: .. \ntrine. Its fusion of total scepticism and total perfectionism has \nsecured the loyalty of millions to the insane tyranny of Stalin, \nand this disaster was intrinsic to the modern mind. \nIt engulfed \nsome of the ablest and most generous among\u00b7us. \n* \nIt may appear extravagant to hope that these self-destructive \nforces of the modern mind could b~ har~onized by reconsidering the \nway we know things. If I yet believe, that a basic reconsideration \nof knowledge may be effective today, it is beca4se, for some time \npast, a revulsion has been noticeable against the ideas which \nbrought us to our present state. \nDoth inside and outside the Soviet \nEmpire, men are getting weary of ideas qerived from the fusion of \nscientific scepticism and moral perfectionism, \nSuspicion is growing \nthat something is fundamentally wrong here. \nThis revisionist move-\nment can be assisted by basing our thoughts on truer grounds, \nI have prepared for this effDrt in certain respects .. Everything \nI have said implied my repudiation of the grounds on which the ab-\nsolute intellectual and moral self-determination of man was pro-\nclaimed by the great philosophic movement which supplied ideas of \nthe French Revolution. \nTo acknowledge tacit thought as an indispen-\nsable element of all knowing and as the ultimate mental power by \nwhich all explicit knowledge is endo~ied with meaning, is to deny the \n\n\u2022,,, \n. ' \n,;j \n6 \npossibility that each succeeding generation, let alone each member \nof it, should critically test all the teachings in which we are \nbrought up. \nStatements explicitly derived from identifiable premises \ncan be critically tested by examing their premises, ancl:.tl;w process \n. _-, \nt..::\"\"!- : . , \nof inference which led to them. \nDut, if we know a greati.@e:dl that \n. - \u00b7., ,:\u00b7-.. '. \nwe cannot tell, and if even that which we know and can tell is ac-\ncepted by us as true only in view of its bearing on a reality beyond \nit, a reality: which can yet manifest itself in the future in an in-\ndeterminate range of unsuspected ways; if indeed we recognize a \ngreat discovery, a great idea, or else a great personality, as most \nreal, owing to the wider range of their yet unknown future manifesta-\ntions; then the idea of knowledge based.on wholly identifiable \n-,~ \ngrounds collapses, and we must conclude that the transmission of \nknowledge from one generation to the other must be predominantly \ntacit. \nI have spoken of the effort that a person receiving a message \nmust make, in order to understand it. Higher learning and the arts \nand skills can be taught only to pupils eager to make a great effort \nto understand theiP teachers and imitate their skill. \nA tacit knowl-\nedge is a dwelling in our awareness -of particulars in terms of an \nentity they jointly constitute. \n1n order to share this indwelling, \nthe pupil must presume that a teaching which appears meaningless to \n.t' \nstart with, has in fact a meaning which can be discovered by hitting \non the same kind of indwelling as the teacher is practicing. \nThink of the amazing deployment of the infant mind. \nIt is \nstirred on by a veritable blaze of confidence, surmising the hidden \nmeaning of speech and other adult behaviour. \nAnd this holds for all \n\n7 \nsubsequent stages of learning. \nInteriorisation can proceed only by \naccepting the particulars bearing on the ideas which they convey \nwithout attending to these particulars, \nWe may never be able to \nidentify any of the premises of a culture in which. we. are growing up, \n\u00b7:_v'.\" __ ,:. ~----~\u2022 \nany more than we will be able to tell what principles \\~e 'ifrei tacitly \n' \n,}J..:;_f: \napplying in using our senses: and our body. \nAt each step\u00b7 ~le accept, \nand must accept, unidentifiable grounds, trusting that the practice \nbased on them is sound and the ideas conveyed by them true. \nA \nscepticism which would avoid this would spell total imbecility. St. \nAugustine has observed this, when--basing himself on Scripture--he \nsaid: \n\"unless ye believe, ye shall not understand.\" \nIt appears then that traditionalism, which requires us to \nbelieve before we know, and in order tha:t we may know, is based on \na deeper insight into the nature of knowledge, than is a scientific \nrationalism, which would permit us to believe only explicit state-\nments based on specific data and derived by a formal inference which \nwe have previously tested. \nDut I am not re-asserting traditionalism here for the purpose \nof supporting dogmatism. \nI admit that my re-affirmation of tradi-\ntionalism might have a bearing on religious teaching, but I want to \nset this aside here. \nFor I believe that modern man\u2022s\u00b7critical lucid-\nity must be reconciled with his unlimited moral demands, first of \nall, on secular grounds. \nWe should hope to derive religious en-\nlightenment and perhaps a religious renewal from such a reconcilia-\ntion, rather than try to invol{e the authority of revealed religion \nfor achieving this reconciliation, \nNeither am I going back on the impetus of the French Revolution. \n\ntt \n.... \n8 \nI accept its dynamism, and share both its intellectual and its \nsocial aspirations. \nDut I believe that the self-determination of \nman, proclaimed by the Enlightenment, can be saved from destroying \nitself only by recognising its own limits in an aut~ef:~:::ive tradi-\ntional, framework which upholds it. Tom Paine could proc'fa.i!ll the \n-!~ti: .. ~~ \nright of each generation to determine anew its political\\i~stitu-\ntions, for the range of this demand was in fact very limited. \nHe \nunquestioningly accepted the traditional continuity of culture as \n', \nthe framework of self-determination. \nToday, the ideas of Tom Paine \ncan be saved from self-destruction only by a conscious re-affirmation \nof cultural continuity. \nTom Paine's intentions can be upheld only \nby the kind of traditionalism pro~e~sed by Paine's opponent, Edmund \nDurke. \n* \nI shall define this traditionalism by analysing the peculiar \nway in which the pursu:l,t of scientific discovery is organised. \n, Science is systematic; but, as a whole, it is not ordered ex-\nplicitly, like the systematic chart of the animal kingdom. \nAdmit-\ntedly, science is divided into branches, and the branches are sub-\ndivided into narrower subjects. \nDut the advancement of any one \npart of science depends directly on the progress of many other \nparts, possibly any other part. \nSo the system of science forms a \ncomplex network. \nAny major discovery may weave new strands into / \nthis network, and may even reorganise it altogether. \nWhen Max von \nLaue discovered the diffraction of X-rays by crystals in 1912, \ncrystallography was a dull subject, to be mugged up without a \nthought; fifty years later, it had become the center of an intel\u2022\u00b7 \nlectual empire 1\u00b7rith provinces in every part of science, . \n\n9 \nMilton has compared truth with a shattered statue, the scat-\ntered fragments of which have to be collected and fitted together. \nDut when you put together the fragments of a statue, you can see \ngaps where parts are missing and can see roughly the 'shap,e:.,_,,these \n. \u00b7~\u00b7, \n?,..,::-: . , \nmissing parts must have in order to fit into a particulan.i(gap. Not \nso in science. \nTo the average student, the system of science is \nalways complete. \nIts gaps are visible only to exceptional minds \nwho can sense'\u00b7 the hidden possibilities to which present scientific \nknowledge offers clues. \nThe heuristic vision of their subject and \nof its relations to other parts of science guides them to their \nproblems and sets them on the path to discovery. \nThis brings us to the curious \u00b7relation of an individual scien-\ntist to the system of science. \nNo single scientist knows more than \na tiny part of science and his view of this fragment ~s highly per-\nsonal. \nHow can we yet confidently speak of science as a systematic \nbody of knowledge, and can we rely on it that science has the same \nscientific character throughout this body? \nThe answer to this lies in a principle that, to my knowledge, \nhas never yet been stated, even though it is commonly practised in \nvarious fields. \nI would call it the _Principle of Overlapping Neigh-\n' \nborhoods. \nEvery mature scientist knows an important part of science \nat first hand and can testify to its rich connections with other \nparts of science. \nThis is as much as he can actually see of the \nsystem of science. \nDut there are other scientists, cultivating ad-\njoining fields, who see a similar fragment of science, parts of \nwhich overlap with the area well known to the first scientist. \nCon-\n\u2022 \nsequently, when the first scientist finds that the judgments of his \n\n.. \n10 \nneighbours about these overlapping areas is sound, he can take their \nword for it that science has systematic relations also in other \nI \ndirections beyond the overlapping areas and that the entire domains \nof his neighbours have the same scientific character ?,Sc-l:lis o~m. \n' )----,y-\u2022t:,-_..,:, \nSuch reliance is of course mutual, and extends. further \u00b7rr6~' tihe \n. \n~:~~;~~-;~. \nfirst scientist's neighbours in turn to their neighbours,\u00b7and so \non indefinitely. \nThus the whole of science, of which no one can \nknow at first\\hand more than a tiny fragment, is covered by a net-\nwork of overlapping neighbourhoods. \nThrough this network every \nscientist participates in watching over the systematic coherence \nand scientific character of all science. \nIt is by trusting the operations, .ot this network, and only by \ntrusting it, that we can say that a systematic body of science \nexists. \nAnd when we say that science is a. public_. domain of knowl-\nedge, we mean that, in view of this network, any particular scien-\ntific statement may be deemed to be accredited at second hand by \nall other scientists; and that we might c.onceivably find one pre-\npared to demonstrate its truth to our satisfaction. Though it must \nbe admitted, that such demonstration would hardly convince us, but \nfor the fact, that we would trust the scientist, because he is \ntrusted by his fellows. \nThe network of mutual surveillance v1hich \nsecures the existence of a systematic body of knowledge to the \nsatisfaction of its participants, imposes its acceptance on laymen, \nby virtue of the confidence granted by laymen. to the body of scien-\ntists as a whole, \nIf, for any reason, a serious break should develo~ \neither in the internal network of science, or between it and the \ngeneral public, the existence of science as a systematic body of \n\n+ \nI \n11 \npublic knowledge would be called in question. \nThe situation is not without risks, for science is not a body \nof fixed knowledge, but an expanding enterprise. \nTo secure the \ncontinued coherence of science, and its authority over- .-laymen--on \n. ~- \u00b7\u00b7-;:r-::, .... ,. \n\u2022\u2022 \nj.-\u2022 ..... \n, \nwhich science must rely for it'3 public support.:.-the netwo:ik'.l)lust \n':~~;~..;;. i_. .\u2022. \ncontrol a steady flow of accretions coming from new discoveries. \nHere we see an exercise of authority, based on tradition, coming \nfully into vie.w. \nI have mentioned in my first lecture how scientific opinion \ndetermines whether a contribution submitted to a scientific journal \nis sufficiently plausible to be taken seriously. \nThe teachings of \nscience convey at all times certain. basi.c convictions about the \nnature of things and about the method, whlch in consequence, is \nlikely to yield results of scientific value. \nThese beliefs and \nthe art of scientific enquiry based on them, are not codified. In \nthe main, they are tacitly implied in the traditional pursuit of \nscientific enquiry. \nThey have undergone great changes in the course \nof the past four hundred years. \nYet scientific opinion exercises at \nall times a powerful pressure to enforce these premises of scientific \nenquiry. \nContributions which run counter to them are usually refused \npublication and, if published, are \u00b7ignored. \nSuch selection is in-\ndispensable, if journals are not to be rendered useless by carrying \nfloods of nonsense. \nYet the practice is notoriously dangerous, as \nimportant work has sometimes been refused attention. It has also \nled to occasional crises of confidence between scientific opinion \nand the lay public, as in the Velikowski case, and it has happened--\nthough rarely--that in such a conflict, science was wrong and lay \n\n,,; \n12 \nopinion was right. \nMy own quarrel with scientific opinion is large-\nly about its official philosophy, though I have shotm that there are \nconsiderable areas of some sciences the very substance of which has \nbeen warped by tal<ing this false philosophy as its gui'de .\u2022.. Even so, \n. \n. \u00b7-\u2022~-=-\n.. \ni-!\"< .\u2022 \nI am only conce,rned with the false and meaningless image:1-;f!,'the \nuniverse which these distortions of' science present. \nI believe that \nlay judgment has well tested grounds on which to oppose sc;l.entific \nopinion in such matters. \nDut the fact that a statement is accepted to be true, does not \nyet qualify it to form part of' science. \nThere are many true state-\nments which, though very important, are not part of science. \nA \ntrue statement is deemed to form a\u00b7 substantial part of science in \n\" \nthe light of its scientific value. \nThis value is composed of. three \ncoefficients: \n1) its accuracy, 2) its importance for the system \nof science, 3) the ordinary, non-scientific interest of its subject \n~ \nmatter. \nThe same scientific value may be compounded of these three \nvariables in different proportions. \nFor example, though inanimate \nmatter, which is the subject of physics, is not very interesting in \nitself, physics makes up for this by the accuracy of its measurements \nand the beauty of its theories. \nOn the other hand, the discoveries \nof biology, though often not quantifiable and hence devoid of any \nmathematical beauty, richly compensate for such deficiency by the \ngreat human interest of living beings, which are its subject matter. \nThe proper assessment of scientific value is indispensable to \nthe conduct of scientific life. It determines, whether a paper is \nworth publishing, and before that, it necessarily enters into assess-\ning whether a problem is ~,orth pursuing. \nWhat is more, the distribu-\n\n.. \n13 \ntion of funds between different lines of enquiry, indeed, between \ndifferent branches of science, will essentially depend on the com-\nparative scientific value of the result to be expected in these \nalternative directions. \nIndeed the very opportunity for conducting \n\u00b7:.~?~~,;-::,ff;:, \nresearch as an independent scientist, will depend on ari assessment \n.\\it.:t::\u00b7 \nof the scientific value of the work that a candidate for -s:uch a \nposition may be expected to produce. \nNot only do comparative judg-\nments of scientific value determine thus the shape of science, but \n-.. \nthey determine beyond that the very composition of the network of \nscientists, whose collective opinion will make these judgments of \nvalue. \nNot only is science what it is, owing to such judgments, \nbut scientists are what they are, ~y, virtue of their mutual assess-\nment of each other I s merits in the light-. of these values. \nNot a move can be made in scientific life without involving a \nmost delicate and complex assessment of scientific vaiue. \nAny dis-\nagreement on these standards of value causes a serious strain in \nthe fabric of scientific life and any profound disagreement would \nmenace the very existence of science as a coherent system of knowl-\nedge. \nRemember now that these evaluations are exercised by a multitude \nof scientists, each of whom is competent to assess only a tiny frag-\nment of current scientific work. \nConsider that each scientist must \noriginally have established himself by joining at some point the net-\nwork of mutual appreciation extending far beyond his own horizon. \nEach such acceptance appears then as a submission in advance to a \nvast range of value-judgments exercised over all the domains of \nscience, which the newly accepted citizen of science henceforth en-\n\ndorses unseen. \nThus the standards of scientific merit are seen to \nbe transmitted from generation to generation by the affiliation of \nindividuals at a great variety of widely disparate points, in the \nsame way, as artistic, moral or legal traditions are transmitted. \n. \n\u00b7! \\1~::;;. \n. \nAnd we may conclude, that the appreciation of _scientific \u00b7v'.alue too \nJi: i:--\nis based on a tradition which succeeding generations accep:t;'.'and \ndevelop into their own scientific opinion. \nDut thi~ is still only half the story of authority and tradi-\ntional values in the shaping of science. \nFor scientific opinion \nappreciates yet another value and prizes it greatly, and this value \nis opposed to those that I have spol{en so far; it is the value of \noriginality. \nDoth the criteria of plausibility and of accepted \nscientific value enforce conformity, whiie the value attached to \noriginality encourages dissent. \nThis internal tension is essential \nin guiding and motivating scientific work. \nThe professional stand-\nards of science must impose a framework of discipline and at the \nsame time encourage rebellion against it. This is \\\u00b71hy science can \npride itself both on its discipline and its revolutionary daring. \nThe authority of scientific tradition enforces the teachings of \nscience in general for the very purpose of fostering their subver-\nsion in the particular. \nScientific tradition derives this curious capacity for evoking \nopposition to itself and readily assimilating it from its belief in.,\u00b7 \nthe presence of a hidden reality, of v1hich the established teachings \nof science represent only one aspect: \nof a reality that is yet to \nbe revealed more fully by future discoveries. It teaches its ortho-\ndoxy to the novice as a guide to malrn his Olm contact with reality \n\n15 \nby which he shall gain independent grounds to oppose this orthodoxy. \nEach independent discovery, born into the existing system of \nscience, safeguards its coherence, even though by its originality, \nit may profoundly modify the system and even affect the nature of \n\u00b7: )?.:,.;;. ~:;-li,_:4 \nits harmonies. \nEvery generation is responsible for re.:interpreting \n. }JL::} f' \nthe criteria of plausibility and the standards of scientific value \nand originality transmitted by the tradition of science. \nSuch self-\nrenewal of tradition is fateful, and yet unavoidable. \nTo speak of \nscience and of its continued future progress is to share the commit-\nment of scientists and hope for their wisdom in serving it. \nAny \nattempt to replace this shared commitment by exhaustively specify-\ning its grounds, must fail. \nScientific authority is not distributed evenly throughout the \nbody of scientists; some distinguished members of the profession \n' \n, \npredominate over others of a more junior standing. \nDut the author-\nity of scientific opinion remains essentially mutual; it is estab-\nlished reciprocally bet1\u00b71een scientists, n_ot above them. \nThey exer-\ncise their authority over each other, \nOnce the novice has reached \nthe grade of a mature scientist, there is no longer any superior \nabove him. \nThe Republic of Science realises the ideal of Rousseau, of a \ncommunity in which each is an equal partner in the General Will. \nDut seen in this light, the General Will is seen to differ from any<' \nother will in that it cannot alter its purpose. \nThe community of \nscientists would instantly dissolve, if its task came to an end and \nthe members of the community had to decide on doing something else. \nfl subjective choice can be varied at will, but a commitment rooted \n\n16 \nin tradition and bearing on reality, is dissolved by a change of \ndirection. \nThe difference is fur.damental. \nThe Republic of Science, of which I described the constitution, \nis a Society of Explorers, bent on an \nto be accessible and worth achieving. \nbe suited to explorations in the arts, \nindeterminate f.utll;I'e, believed \n. ~- \u00b7:_-<'.?'\"' -~\u00b7~{\u2022 \n, \nA similar constitut1ou should \n''.~~i~ i: \nin literature, in \u2022\\;iays of \nlife, in religion, in politics. \nAll these can advance only by in-\ndependent iniJiatives, mutually adjusted by taking note of each \nother. \nSuch adjustments will include rivalries and conflicts, which, \nin society as a whole, are far more frequent than they are in scienc~ \nEven so, all the independent initiatives must accept for their \nguidance a traditional authority, enfor?ing its own self-renewal \nby cultivating originality among its forlowers. \nElliot sars that \"often, the best, and indeed the most individual \nparts of a poet 1s work may be those in which the dead poets, his \n'---. \nancestors, assert their immortality most vigorously.\" \nAnd of the \nscope of ancestral ideas he wrote in Little Gidding: \nAnd what the dead had no speech for, when living, \nThey can tell you, being dead: \nthe communication \nOf the dead is tongued with fire beyond the language of the \nliving. \nWe have seen that what Copernicus had no speech for when living, he \ncould tell, being dead, to Kepler, Galileo and Newton. \nWe may safely assume then that the powers of anticipation, in-,> \nherent in tradj.tion, are alike in poetry and in science. Elizabeth \nSewell has been demonstrating for some years past that poetry can \nactually anticipate scientific discovery. \n* \nIt was the problems of the modern mind, which have led me to \n\n17 \nexplore the traditional grounds of scientific discovery and to \nglance at similar grounds in other creative work throughout society. \nWe can see now that the absolute intellectual, moral and political \nself-determination implied in the teachings of scientit,i;q rational-\n. \n. -\u2022.\u2022 ~~-4 \n. \n~_;.; ;: , \nism, is absurd. \nAnd we can see that the doctrine, going:,RB-~k to \n- -. '; ;-...

It is organised like scientific life by the mutual \nadjustment of-independent initiatives guided by an authority recip-\nrocally imposed on each other by its members. \nIt is a Society of \nExplorers, teaching its dynamic tradition, which constantly renews \nitself by fostering originality. \nThese creative innovations are \npersonal--intensely personal--acts, but their intent is universal, \nfor they are dictated by a compelling responsibility for advancing \ntrue thought and noble actions. \nWherever men have rightly spoken \n\n18 \nin the name of truth, saying, Here I stand and cannot do otherwise, \nwe instantly recognise both the power of impersonal truth and the \ngreatness of the mind upholding it. \nWe readily identify both the \npersonal and the universal pole of such a commitment. \n\u2022f ;2?..:.;.:.... . \nWhether we date it to Luther or to Copernicus, or-tci~~tne French \n-!-Ii: '; :\u00b7 \nRevolution, our heritage is this Society of Explorers, o:e\u00b7:which I \nhave traced the constitution and defined the metaphysical founda-\ntions. \nThe freedom and responsibility of modern man is guaranteed \nby this framework and circumscribed by it.

Some \nphysicists, including Niels Dohr, tried to link the two domains by\u00b7 \na transitional principle which would yield the two different sys-\ntems of physics as the two solutions appropriate for large and small \nparticles, respectively, \nWhen quantum mechanics was \u00b7discovered, it \noffered just such a principle. \nWe are facing a similar situation and, with luck, may mal<e as \n\n21 \n,-\ngood a guess at a future solution. \nAt one end we have the domain \nof inanimate nature, at the other, the highest form of life repre-\nsented by a creative \n\\ \nwill account for the \na transition between \nact of the mind, \nThe missing principle which \nemergence of man from the inanimate, must form \nthe two domains. \nLook first at inanimate nature. \nIt is controlled by forces \nwhich draw matter towards stabler configurations. \nThese forces may \nbe held in check by friction, which can be released by various agent~ \nsome of them uncaused. \nThe decomposition of a radioactive atom may \nbe the uncaused cause of an explosion. \nTo sum up: \nwe see forces \ndriving towards stabler potentialities, which, when locked by fric-\ntion, can be released by uncaused events controlled only by probabil-\nities. \nCreative innovations are evoked likewise by an\u00b7anticipation of \ntheir hidden potentiality. \nIn the inanimate domain the accessibility \nof a stabler position produces a force, in the mind it produces a \nproblem. \nThis heuristic tension is released by choices, that are \nhazardous and appear uncaused. \nDut such gropings are not random; \nthey are not controlled by statistical probability but by a heuristic \neffort, seeking the truth. \nThe great difference is that the mind produces something new, \na new comprehension controlled by a new level of existence which the \ninanimate does not do, \nWe may surmise then that the quality of con-\nsciousness resides, that is absent in the inanimate. \nIn my last lecture I identified emergence, which creates new \nlevels of existence, with comprehension by tacit knowing. \nSuch \norganic innovations should now be regarded as due to the release of \n\n22 \n( \npotentialities by the gropings of uncaused events. \nI have spoken \nof the gradual intensification of the center in living things, ac-\ncompanied by an increasing value of its actions and exposing it to \never more serious reproaches, \nThis process, culminating in the \ngreatness and misery of moral responsibility, would have its place \nhere, at the very point where consciousness arises to grant us the \ncapacity for facing responsibility. \n* \nThe over-all title I gave to these lectures was \"Man in Thought'; \nI wanted to speak of the logical interrelation between living and \nthinking in man and to extend this interrelation by tracing the \njoint ancestry of man and thought, all the way back to their inani-\nmate antecedents. \nI have introduced a number of new principles, \n( \ncrowded on top of each other, for I could not resist the temptation \nof glancing at a set of ideas appearing on the horizon. \nDut I feel that, actually, all I have tallrnd about presents a \nsingle, fairly simple vision. \nThis part of the universe, in which \nman has arisen, seems to be filled with a field of potentialities \nwhich evoke action. \nThe action thus evoked in inanimate matter is \nrather poor, perhaps quite meaningless. \nDut inanimate matter, \nmatter that is both lifeless and deathless, takes on a new meaning \nby originating living things. \nWith them a hazard enters the hitherto \nunerring universe: \nthe hazard of life and death. \nThe field of new \npotential meanings opened up was so rich that this enterprise swept \non towards an infinite range of higher meanings, unceasingly pouring \nthem into existence, for the better part of a billion years. \nAlmost \nfrom the start this evolutionary response to potential meaning had \n\n23 \n\\\n1 \nits counterpart in the behaviour of the living things it brought \nforth. \nIt seems that even protozoa have the faculty of learning; \nthey respond to potential meaning. \nRising stages of evolution pro-\nduce more meaningful organisms, capable of ever more complex feats \nof understanding. \nIn the last few thousand years we, men, have \nenormously increased the range of comprehension by equipping our \ntacit powers \\'/ith an explicit cultural machinery of language and \nwriting. \nImmersed in this cultural milieu we n01., respond to a vastly \nincreased range of potential thought. \nIt is the image of humanity immeFsed in potential thought that \nI find revealing in its bearing on the problems of our day. \nIt \nrids us of the absurdity of absolute self-determination, yet offers \n,--;,\\ each of us the chance of creative originality, within the fragmentary \n'-\n, \\ area which circumscribes our calling.

    "content_html": "<p>Lecture 1 Science and Reality. by Michael Polanyi (Delivered at Wesleyan University, September 29, 1965) The subject of this lecture is to introduce to you a con- ception which has for two and a half millennia been the guide of all major efforts to understand nature, but which has been repu- di1J.ted by the modern interpretation of science. I mean the con- ception of reality. Rarely if ever will you find it taught today that the purpose of science is to discover the hidden reality underlying the facts of nature. The modern ideal of science is to establish a precise mathematical relationship between the facts without acknowledging that such a mathematical relationship is of interest to science only because it is a sign that we have hit upon a feature of reality. My purpose is to bring back the idea of reality and place it at the center of a true conception of scientific enquiry, and of science itself, Admittedly, the re- surrected idea of reality will look very different from its defunct ancestor. Instead of being the absolutely clear and firm ground of all appearances, it will turn out to be known to us q\u00b5ite vaguely, with an inexhaustible range of expectations attached to it. * It is common knowledge that Copernicus overthrew the anr,ient view that the sun and the planets go round the earth and that he established instead the system in which it is the sun that is the center around which all planets circle, and the earth it- self goes round the sun as one of the planets, on a par with them. &#x27; ,j~. &#x27;\\ But do not find it recognised, that it was by the way this dis- covery was interpreted by Copernicus and his immediate followers, that the metaphysical foundations of modern science were estab- lished, The decisive issue between the Copernicans and their critfcs was, whether the heliocentric was real. Whether it was no more than a new computing device, but was as the Copernice.ns affirmed it, a real image of the sun and the planets in motion. For thirty years Copernicus hesitated to publish his theory, because he dare not oppose the teachings of Aristotle by affirming that the heliocentric system he had set up was real, Two years before the publication of his book in 1543, a protestant clergyman called Osiander commented on the preliminary communica- tions of Copernicus&#x27; system by a letter urging Copernicus to acknow- ledge that science can only produce hypotheses representing the phenomena without claiming,to be true. Later, Osiander succeeded in introducing an Address to the Reader into the published book of Copernicus, expressing the same philosophic views as before and denying the reality of the Copernican system. And the issue was still the same over half a century later in Kepler&#x27;s defence of Tycho Brahe against his critics and above all, almost a century lRter in the conflict between Galileo and Cardinal Belarmine, re- presenting the Pope and the Inquisition. The conflict was due entirely to Galileo&#x27;s refusal to accept the view that the helio- centric system was merely a convenient hypothesis, and not a state- ment of fact, It is strange, that about the turn of the last century the modern criticism of science initiated by Ernst Mach and vigo- rcuRly supported by Henri Poincare, could coolly declare that the cloim l&#x27;lhich Copernicus, Kepler and Galileo so bitterly defended was in fact illusory. They taught that science consists in estab- lishing functional relations between facts and that anything that goes beyond this is undemonstrable. To speak of a reality under- lying these relations was a metaphysical statement, without sub- stantial content and irrelevant to science. During the past half century these earlier statements of positivism have been first sharpened into logical positivism and then toned down again by various qualifications which so far as I can see give up any attempt at defining the nature and justification of natural science. There has bsen sharp opposition to the posi- tivist movement by individual writers, particularly the recently deceased great historian of science, Alexandre Koyre, supported up to a point by Margenau and Gerald Holton. But I see no recog- nition of the fact, which I propose to tell you about in these lectures, that the great achievement of the Copernican revolution . was that it established the true metaphysical foundations of science, on which modern science still rests. * I shall try to explain what made Copernicus feel that the new system he proposed was real. For this purpose, I shall give you the simplest possible image of a particular feature of the old system and a greatly simplified version of the way the new system dealt with the same subject. When you watch the position of a planet from a point in the northern hemisphere, you see its position shifting night after night through the firmament of fixed stars. It moves predominantly from west to east; but not steadily; it speeds up, slows down, even retraces its steps and the&#x27;&#x27; continues eastwards again. It passes through these retrogressions at regular intervals. The Ptolemaic system explained these retrogressions by assuming that the planet instead of circling round its orbit is carried round it sitting on the edge of a wheel. While this wheel circles round planet&#x27;s orbit, it keeps turning round its axle and produces thereby loops in the planet&#x27;s motion round its orbit. These loops are seen from the earth as retrogressions. Such wheels are known as epicycles, and the particular type I am describing are the major epicycles. The effect of epicyclical motion can be understood best by assuming that the planet has for the moment discontinued its main eastward motion around its orbit. Viewed from the earth at rest, the image of the planet among the fixed stars will oscillate then at the rate of its passage around the epicycle. Add then to the oscil- lation once more the orbital motion to the east and you obtain the retrogression or looping as observed from the earth. The fundamental idea of Copernicus was that instead of having the planets circling on epicyclical wheels, we can get the same effect by putting the earth into a circular motion round the sun. You can see how this works if you imagine once more a planet arrested in its orbital motion and trace then its image in the firmament of stars. The image oscillates in the same way as the planet was seen to oscillate in the Ptolemaic system. And if we add once more to this oscillation the eastward orbital motion of / the planet, we get the observed looping explained. It is explained / now as a mere illusion, without any epicyclical motion. I will invite you now to put yourself mentally into the position of the thirteen centuries preceding Copernicus. Though it is not easy to find indications of this in the writings of this f-&quot;&#x27; age, I feel sure that astronomers has noticed two things about the epicycles. li&#x27;ir~t, all the wheels representing epicycles were seen to go round at the same rate and this period was equal to one year. In consequence of this a planet like Mars, circling its orbit in about two years passes through two loops a year, while Jupiter which rounds its orbit in 12 years passes through 12 loops and Saturn which takes 30 years to go round makes 30 loops on the way. Second, the apparent size of the wheels representing the observed loops was observed steadily to decrease with the increas- ing length of orbital periods from Mars, through Jupiter, to Saturn. Moreover it seemed reasonable to assume that all the planets move about the same speed and that if some take longer to go round their orbit, this is because their orbital circles are larger. So the orbit of Saturn must be largest, Jupiter have a smaller orbit and Mars&#x27; orbit must be smaller still. You will now see that all three features of the old system follow from the Copernican theory. In the first place, it is ob- vious that, since epicycles are replaced by an illusory oscillation due to the annual motion of the earth round the sun, this osciJla- tion must always take place at the same rate, equalling one year. The second point, the difference in the angle of oscillations, arises now by placing the several planets at different distances from the earth. Indeed, in order to explain any particular angle of oscil- lation,~~ place the planet at a definite distance. In other words, the theory fixes the solar distance of each planet in pro- portion to the solar distance of the earth, and this yields our _!hird QQint: It confirms the ancient surmise, that the size of planetary orbits gets steadily larger as the orbital period gets longer. Such was thetriumph of Copernicus. The major epicycles were wiped out as illusory. The equality of their periods and the fact that they equal one year is deduced and the fact that the angle of oscillation of the planetary loops decreases as the period of orbital period increases is accounted for by placing the several planets at appropriate distances as a result of which we obtain a sequence of solar distances which increases with the orbital periods, as had always been thought to be reasonable. All this was deduced from the one single idea of placing the sun as the center of the planetary system and moving the earth from the * center into the position of a planet circling round the sun. It is on the $uccess of this fundamental idea, setting aside the infinite complications of its ultimate execution, that Copernicus based his claim that his system was real. In the pre- face addressed to Pope Paul III he writes that he has at last discovered that, if the motions of&#x27;the rest of the planets be brought intb relation with the circulation of the Earth and be reckoned in prbportion to the orbit of each planet, not only do their phenomena presently ensue, but the orders and magnitudes of all stars and spheres, nay the heavens themselves, become so bound together that nothing in any part thereof could be moved from its place without producing confusion of all the other parts and of the Universe as a whole. Everything is now bound together, he claims, and this is a sign that the system is real. Other passages are more specific, but the analysis I have given is but my own reconstruction of the result Copernicus had in mind, no exact specification of it is given in his book. He speaks fervently of the harmonies he has estab- lished but gives no precise definition of its claims. * * This account of the Copernican system is admittedly much abbre- viated by disregarding for the moment the two planets Mercury and Venus the orbits of which lie inside the orbit of the earth. Suffice to say, that these fit in with the picture I have given and thus ~ strengthen further the principles of the Copernican system. It is recorded that Petrarca, living in the neighbourhood of Avignon early in the fourteenth century, was one of the first mounteneers and climbed the Mont Saint Victoire, famous by Cezanne 1 ll painting of it. But so novel was the rapture he felt,that he would find no words for it, though every schoolboy has them ready today. Faced with his unprecedented ~chievement of a great sdientific discovery, Copernicus was incapable of telling clearly what had deeply convinced him. But today it is clear that what he discove- red was a coherent image of previously scattered features and this was what convinced him that he was facing the true nature of the planetary system. But why exactly did this claim evoke such protest among his contemporaries, particularly by the clergy? The medieval teaching which clerics from Osiander to Belarmin\u00b0defended, goes back to Aristotle. It derived all essential features of the uni- verse from necessary first principles, such as the perfection of creation. For example, the divine perfection of steady circular motion required., that the course of all heavenly bodies be . con- structed from such motions. Copernicus himself insisted on this at the cost of introducing absurd complications into his system. Even Galileo adhered to it. This view excluded the possibility or \u00a3.-or-discovering ultimate features of nature by the empirical ob- servations of the astronomer. Only philosophy was competent to reach such conclusions. Centuries later the positivists declared once more that science can say nothing about ultimate reality, but theirs was a very different reason, namely that any such claim was meaningless. Their purpose was to purify science of such empty metaphysical implications. The meaning of these two different attacks on Copernicanism the medieval and the positivist attacks, and the position of Coper- nicus himself can be illustrated by a diagram. The medieval posi- tion shows reason as conceived by them, bearing directly on reality, while barring science from any such be~ring. The positivist move- ment is shown isolating sdience both from basic reason and from reality. Regarded as a convenient relation of given facts, science is self contained. Copernicanism is shown, thirdly, claiming to apply basic reason through empirical science for discovering reality. Copernicus has made for the first time the metaphysical claim that science can discover new knowledge about fundamental re_ality and this claim triumphed in the Copernican revolution. Later the claim of science to know reality was disowned by the positivist critique of metaphysics; I myself agree with Copernicus. j In my opinion it is impossible to pursue science without believing / that it can discover reality and I want to re-establish his belief. Let us try to understand then what Copernicus believed by saying that his system was real. We shall find a clue to this if we first look at a more active form of this belief which Kepler and Galileo have manifested when undertaking their enquiries. They testified to their belief that the Copernican system was real, by relying on it as a guide to discovery. We know that this confidence proved justified. I shall show this for Kepler. His Third Law, discovered sixty six years after the death of Copernicus, developed the feature of the heliocentric system, which Copernicus mentioned as its most striking harmony, namely the fact that all six planets recede steadily further from the sun in the sequence of their longer orbital periods. Kepler lent precision to this relationship by showing that the cube of solar distances is proportional to the square of the orbital periods. His other great discovery, made ten years earlier of his First and Second Laws, was in a sense a departure from Copernicus. It broke away from the doctrine of steady circular planetary motions and introduced instead an elliptic path and a law of variable velocities related to the ;ellipse. Yet this elliptic path, with the Sun in one focus of it, // was firmly tied to the heliocentric system. It could never have \\ been discovered from Ptolemy&#x27;s image of the planetary system. I would not hesitate to say that these discoveries proved the reality of the Copernican system but this is because I know what Newton discovered towards the end of the same century, namely that these threE!_laws of Kepler were expressions of the law of universal gravitation. At the time Kepler put his laws forward, mixed up with a number of other numerical rules that proved falla- cious, the effect of his three laws was not widely convincing; Galileo himself was unimpressed by them. But for the moment I can set this aside, for I am only trying to understand what Kepler and Galileo believed about the Copernican system, when they relied / on their conviction that it was real and therefore a proper guide \\ to their enquiries. In a sense it is easy to see what happened in Kepler&#x27;s and Galileo&#x27;s thought, Relying on the reality of the Copernican system, they recognised the presence of problems, which after many years were to prove fruitful. But how did the Copernican system indicate to them good problems that where not visible in the Ptolemaic system? This raises a general question, which to my knowledge, has never been systematically examined, The question is&#x27;l What is a problem? Not the kind of problem set to students of mathematics or to chemists in practical classes but a scientific problem the solution of which is unknown; and yet a problem the scientist may embark on with a reasonable hope to discover something new that will be worth the 1kbour and expenses of the search for it, I would answer that to have such a problem, a good problem is to surmise the presence of something hidden, and yet possibly accessible, lying in a certain direction. Enquiry stats with such a vague surmise and it may still remain uncertain to the end what exactly might be discovered by its pursuit. Such a problem is evoked in the imagination of a scientist by a set of circumstances which he recognises as clues to something hidden. And when the problem is solved these clues will be seen to form part of the hidden thing thus discovered. The clues of a problem thus anti- cipate aspects of a future discovery and guide the questing mind to make the discovery. We can say then that Kepler&#x27;s feeling that the Copernican system was real, was expressed by his belief that its image anticipated aspects of something still hidden, that might be accessible by research in certain directions. And we may add, that Kepler&#x27;s discoveries similarly raised problems in Newton&#x27;s mind by the fact that Kepler&#x27;s laws anticipated aspects of the still hidden laws of gravitation, which Newton was to discover. Thus Newton too was guided by a belief in the reality of the Copernican system. The belief which the followers of Copernicus placed in the reality of the Copernican system consisted then in imputing to it still hidden implications, vaguely suggested by the presence of possible anticipations sensed in certain features of the system. Their belief in its reality was a feat of the questing imagination, essential to their creative achievement. * Let us take stock of the position we have reached. In the history of the Copernican Revolution we have found it possible to discriminate the explicit statements of the theory from its anti- cipatory powers. The celestial time-table set out by Copernicus was not markedly different from that of Ptolemy. Close on to a century following the death of Copernicue, all efforts to discri- minate convincingly between the two systems on the grounds of their observable quantitative predictions have failed. While the dis- coveries of Kepler and Galileo based on the heliocentric system greatly increased its plausibility and eventually convinced most astronomers, the general effect, judged for example by the re- sponses of Bacon and Milton, was not conclusive. Yet all this time the theory of Copernicus was exercising heuristic powers to- tally absent in the system of Ptolemy. We are faced there with the question how one of two theoretical systems, having the same explicit content, can vastly exceed the other in its anticipations. The answer is there already in my description of the anti- cipatory suggestions offered by the Copernican system. Its anti- cipatory powers lay in the new image by which Copernicus repre- sented the predictive content of the Ptolemaic system. It is in the al?peardnce of the new system that lay its immense superiority; it is this image that made the Copernican revolution. I am drawing here a distinction which will prove decisive. I distinguish between the precise predictive content of a mathe- matical theory consisting in a functional relation of measured variables and a meaning of the theory which goes beyond this. While these functional relations remain the same, the surplus of meaning which goes beyond them may vary with the appearance of the theory. The way this may come about can be illustrated from every- day life. Suppose we have a list of all the towns of England, each with its precise longitude and latitude, and the number of its in- habitants and we now represent these data in a map, each town being marked by a circle corresponding to it in size. The mapping of the list adds no new data to it, yet it conveys a far deeper under- standing of these data. !t reveals for example the way the popula- tion is distributed through the country and suggests questions about the reasons of physical geography and history which will account for this distribution. The map will guide the imagination to enter on fruitful enquiries to which the original list would leave us blind. E. M. Foster has shown a similar difference between two kinds of characters in a novel. There are flat characters whose behavior can be precisely predicted and round characters which develop creatively; the latter are more real and hence have the power. convincingly to surprise us. By bearing on reality, scien- tific theories also have the power convincingly to surprise us. But before going further, I must yet enter a caveat. The distinction between explicit content and informal heuristic powers is profound, but not absolute. No mathematical theory means any- thing except as understood by him who applies it, and such an act of understanding and applying is no explicit operation; it is necessarily informal. Great discoveries have indeed been made by merely finding novel instances to which an accepted theory applies. Vant&#x27; Hoff&#x27;s discovery that the mass action law of chemistry was an instance of the Second Law of thermodynamics was a fundamental achievement. When I speak of the explicit content of a theory, I refer to such applications of it which, though informal, are fairly obviouF These I distinguish from the yet indeterminate meaning of the theory that may be revealed only much later, by a creative act of a scientist&#x27;s imagination. This type of discovery is also based on a firm belief in the bearing which an accepted theory has on reality. But was Copernicus himself, when expressing his belief in the reality of his system, in fact asserting that it had anticipa- tory powers, which the Ptolemaic system had not? It is not clear how anticipatory powers can be known at all, except in the act of relying on them as clues to an enquiry. Copernicus certainly did not know that his system represented an aspect of Kepler&#x27;s laws and of Newton&#x27;s theory of general gravitation. Indeed, being wedded to an explanation of the planetary system in terms of steady circular motions, he would have absolutely rejected Kepler&#x27;s Law and Newton&#x27;s theory based on them. Yet his belief that his system was real, was basically akin to that of his great successors. For he based his claim on those features of his system which were to serve as clues to the problems of Kepler and Newton. He cited in its favour the regular increase of orbital periods with increasing distance from the sun and also the position of the sun at the center controlling the whole order of planets. But there is a more general kinship between the commitment of Copernicus to his belief that his system was real and that of his followers who relied on it for their problems. What Copernicus believed of his system, certainly included what we commonly mean by saying that a thing is real and not a mere figment of the mind. We mean then that the thing will not dissolve like a dream, but that, in one way or another it will yet manifest its existence inexhaustibly in the future, It is there, whether we believe it or not, persisting independently of us, and hence never fully predictable in its consequences. The anticipatory powers which Kepler, Galileo and Newton revealed in the heliocentric system, were but more precise details of the general anticipations that are intrinsic to any belief in reality. We may indeed define reality and truth as follows. If anything is believed to be capable of a largely indeterminate range of future manifestations, it is thus believed to be real. A statement about nature is believed to be true if it is believed to disclose an aspect of something real in nature. A true physi- cal theory is, therefore, no mere functional relation between ob- served facts, but represents an aspect of reality, which may yet manifest itself inexhaustibly in the future. But we must yet explain the fact that the general appearance of the Heliocentric system made Copernicus and his followers be- lieve that it was real. It was its close coherence, its intellec- tual harmonies that had this power over them. For the existence of a harmonious order is a denial of randomness; order and randomness are mutually exclusive. And we may add that anything that is random is meaningless, while anything that is orderly is meaningful. Take the difference between a tune and a noise; or, more generally, between a message and a noise. Communication theory defines a noise, by contrast to any distinctive series of signals, as a random sequence and it says that, as such, noise conveys no information - means nothing. Note also an important difference in the identifiability of an ordered sequence, as compared with a noise. Any single message is represented ideally by only one configuration of signals,</p>\n<p>- 15 ~ while for a noise the very opposite holds. No significance must be attached to any particular configuration of signals that are a noise. We must indiscriminately identify any particular configu- ration of a noise with any other configuration of it. And this is true of any random aggregate! the chance events which compose it could have as well happened otherwise. By contrast, once we have recognised an aggregate of events as orderly and meaningful, we do not think that they might just as well have happened diffe- rently. Such an aggregate is deemed an identifiable thing, posses- sing reality in the sense I have defined it; namely, that it may yet manifest itself inexhaustibly in the future, To distinguish meaningful patterns from random aggregates is therefore to exer- cise our power for recognising reality. Our capacity for discerning meaningful aggregates, as distinct from chance aggregates, is an ultimate power of our per- sonal judgment. It can be aided by explicit argument but never determined by it: our final decision will always remain tacit. Such a distinction may be so obvious, that our tacit powers are used effortlessly and their use remain unnoticed. Our eyes and ears continuously commit us to such decisions automatically. But other decisions of this kind may be hard and momentous. A jury may be presented with a pattern of circumstantial evidence pointing to the accused. It is always conceivable that this pattern may be due to chance. How unlikely a chance should they admit to be possible? Or else, what degree of coincidence should be deemed quite unbelievable? The prisoner&#x27;s life and the administration of justice will depend on the decision, and there is no rule by which it can be decided. I have said that reality in nature is a thing that persists and may yet manifest itself unexhaustibly, far beyond our present ken. Something must be added to this description, if the pursuit of natural science is to be justified. Consider that the Coper- nican revolution w~s but a continuation of a structuring that had its origins in antiquity. Copernicus deepened and beautifully clarified a coherence transmitted by Ptolemy. And this triumph pointed beyond itself in the mind of Copernicus himself, In Kepler, passionately embracing the system bf Copernicus, its image evoked anew the same kind of creative hunger which Copernicus had satis- fied by discovering it. And the presence of yet hidden truth worked its way ever further. To Newton, Kepler&#x27;s three laws appeared to hang together and he established this by his theory of gravitation which jointly derived them from the mechanics of Galileo. Nor was this the end, for a quarter of a millennium later, Einstein was to find unsatisfying the relation of the Newtonian system to the electromagnetic theory of light and was to discover an even deeper coherence to reconcile the two. The continued pursuit ofscience is possible, because the structure of nature and the capacity of the human mind to grasp this structure, can be such as is exemplified by this sequence of discoveries during the past two thousand years. It is frequently the case, that nature is capable of being grasped in successive stages, each of which can be reached only by the highest powers of the human mind. Consequently, to discover a true coherence in nature is often not only to discern something which, by the mere fact of being real, necessarily points beyond itself, but to surmise that future discoveries may prove its reality to be far deeper than we can imagine at present. * It may sound strange that I insist on a belief in the reality of theoretical suppositions as the driving force to dis- covery. Such belief would seem a conservative assumption, rather than a source of innovation. The positivist view of science would indeed claim that the major discoveries of modern physics were based on a sceptical a;ttitude towards the framework of hitherto accepted scientific theories. The discovery of relativity involved the abandonment of the current conceptions of space and time, and quantum mechanics achieved its breakthrough by discarding the planetary system of electrons circling the nucleus, from which Niels Bohr had derived the theory of atomic spectra. Einstein him- self acknowledged that Mach&#x27;s positivist philosophy had inspired his work and Heisenberg&#x27;s quantum mechanics was deliberately framed to reduce atomic theory to a functional relation of observable quantities. These facts may seem to contradict my thesis, but I think they will fall in line with it, if I first make clearer the oppo- site extreme of creative procedure, based on a re11lity of the current framework of scientific &#x27; ftrm belief in the &#x27; theory. We may recognise the prototype of such a feat in the discovery of America by Columbus. :&#x27;t.....- He triumphed by taking literally, and as,&#x27;guide to ,, action, that the earth was round which his contemporaries held vaguely and as a mere matter of speculation. The egg of Columbus is the proverbial symbol for such breath-taking originality guided by a crudely concrete imagination. I remember having the same feeling when first hearing of Einstein&#x27;s theory of Brownian motion. The idea that the meandering oscillations of small floating particles seen under the miscroscope, should reveal the impact of molecules hitting them in accordance with the speculative equations of the kinetic theory of gases, impressed me as grossly incongruous. I had the same feeling of something fantastic, when I heard Elsasser suggesting (in 1925) that certain anomalies observed in the scat- tering of electrons by solids may be due to the optical interference of their de Broglie waves. We had all heard of these waves since 1923, yet were astounded by the fact that they could be taken literally as Elsasser did. This may remind us that the first great move towards the discovery of quantum mechanics was de Broglie&#x27;s idea of the wave nature of matter. This revolutionary idea and Schrodinger&#x27;s deve- lopment of it into wave mechanics, shows no trace of any positivistic influences. Add to this, that Max Planck, the founder of quantum theory, actively opposed Mach&#x27;s analysis of science and dissented from Heisenberg&#x27;s claim of basing physical theories on directly observable ~uantities, 1 and that Einstein himself, whose principle of relativity served as an inspiration to modern positivism, was 2 /Sharply critical of it. It appears then, that the pre-dominant / ./ principle that shaped modern physical theory was not the positivist , program, but the transition from a mechanical conception of reality to a mathematical conception of it, which sometimes coincided with positivistic aims. We can bring thus the revolution of the twentieth century into line with the Copernican revolution of the 16th and 17th century. They both consisted in a stepwise deepening of coherence with a ( simultaneous extension of its range. The modern revolution differed from its precursor in establishing mathematical harmonies in place of beautiful mechanical systems. The mathematical image of reality is more abstract than the mechanical, but its capacity to point beyond its immediate predictive content is similar to that of the mechanical image. I have said that the fact that the wave nature of particles postulated by de Broglie could be confirmed by diffraction experiments, came as a fantastic surprise to physicists. The discovery of the positron came about just as unexpectedly to confirm a prediction contained unnoticed in Dirac&#x27;s quantum theory of the electron (192$). In my account of the Copernican revolution and of the modern revolution in physics, I have mentioned only in passing the contributions made by new experimental observations. But the example~ I gave were typical of the way at this time experiments followed their theoretical anticipation, the connection being often not recog- nized at first. Theoretical speculation and experimental probing entered jointly into a persistent quest towards an ever broader and deeper coherence. * This remark brings up the question, how the actual process of discovery is performed, Much has been written about this with which I disagree, but for the moment I can put my own views only quite summarily. To see a good problem is to see something hidden and yet accessible. This is done by integrating some raw experiences into clues pointing to a possible gap in our knowledge. To under- take a problem is to commit one-self to the(:,J:&gt;eli\\f that you can fill in this gap and make thereby a new_contact with reality. Such a commitment must be passionate; a problem which does not worry us, that does not excite us, is not a problem; it does not exist. With- out such passionate commitment no supporting evidence will turn up, no failure to find such evidence will be felt, no conclusions will be drawn and tested, no quest will take place. Evidence is cast up only by a surmise, a hope of the truth which as such, necessar- ily seeks its own fulfilment. This is how the anticipatory powers I have shown at work in a historical perspective, arouse and guide individual creativity. In these lectures I want to define the mental powers by which ----~---- coherence is discovered in nature. This will establish the theore- tical grounds of scientific enquiry, guided by anticipations of reality. * But this is not enough. The triumph of coherence achieved by the Copernican Revolution filled those brought up on the Medieval order of the universe with dismay. The earth&#x27;s central position which had been the symbol of man&#x27;s destiny as the only thinking morally responsible being, was lost. Gone was the divine perfec- tion of an immutable firmament encircling the place where fallen man was ever to strive for salvation beyond this place. &quot;It is all in pieces, all coherence gone&quot;, wrote John Donne already in 1611. The destruction was deepened by the revival of atomism. Dante had said of Democritos that he &quot;abandoned the world to chance.&quot; And Dante was right. The assumption that all things are ultimately controlled by the same laws of atomic interaction, reduces all forms of existence to accidental collocations of ultimate particles. There are then no essentially higher things, and no __ !11tangible things can be real. To understand the world consists then in representing throughout all that is of greater significance in terms of its less _,/ meaningful elements and if possible, in terms of meaningless matter. Accepting this conception of truth and reality man feels himself</p>\n<p>{ I f menaced by his own lucidity and blighted by self-doubt. The positivist critique of science marks the stage at which the false idea of truth and reality attacks science itself, from which it had originated. If we can overcome these false ideals at this point, this might set an example for our whole outlook and, backed by the very prestige of sciencej help to overcome scientism everywhere. * The recognition of anticipatory powers in science has already supplied us with a conception of reality, which transcends the tangible substratum of things. This will allow us to acknow- ledge higher entities, intangible and yet more real than matter. We shall recognise a hierarchy of being in which man recovers his proper place. He may then feel at home again in the universe.</p>",
    "content_text": "Lecture 1 \nScience and Reality. \nby Michael Polanyi \n(Delivered at Wesleyan University, September 29, 1965) \nThe subject of this lecture is to introduce to you a con-\nception which has for two and a half millennia been the guide of \nall major efforts to understand nature, but which has been repu-\ndi1J.ted by the modern interpretation of science. \nI mean the con-\nception of reality. Rarely if ever will you find it taught today \nthat the purpose of science is to discover the hidden reality \nunderlying the facts of nature. \nThe modern ideal of science is \nto establish a precise mathematical relationship between the facts \nwithout acknowledging that such a mathematical relationship is of \ninterest to science only because it is a sign that we have hit \nupon a feature of reality. \nMy purpose is to bring back the idea \nof reality and place it at the center of a true conception of \nscientific enquiry, and of science itself, \nAdmittedly, the re-\nsurrected idea of reality will look very different from its defunct \nancestor. \nInstead of being the absolutely clear and firm ground \nof all appearances, it will turn out to be known to us q\u00b5ite \nvaguely, with an inexhaustible range of expectations attached to \nit. \n* \nIt is common knowledge that Copernicus overthrew the \nanr,ient view that the sun and the planets go round the earth and \nthat he established instead the system in which it is the sun that \nis the center around which all planets circle, and the earth it-\nself goes round the sun as one of the planets, on a par with them. \n' ,j~. \n'\\ \nBut do not find it recognised, that it was by the way this dis-\ncovery was interpreted by Copernicus and his immediate followers, \nthat the metaphysical foundations of modern science were estab-\nlished, \nThe decisive issue between the Copernicans and their \ncritfcs was, whether the heliocentric was real. \nWhether it was \nno more than a new computing device, but was as the Copernice.ns \naffirmed it, a real image of the sun and the planets in motion. \nFor thirty years Copernicus hesitated to publish his \ntheory, because he dare not oppose the teachings of Aristotle \nby affirming that the heliocentric system he had set up was real, \nTwo years before the publication of his book in 1543, a protestant \nclergyman called Osiander commented on the preliminary communica-\ntions of Copernicus' system by a letter urging Copernicus to acknow-\nledge that science can only produce hypotheses representing the \nphenomena without claiming,to be true. \nLater, Osiander succeeded \nin introducing an Address to the Reader into the published book \nof Copernicus, expressing the same philosophic views as before and \ndenying the reality of the Copernican system. \nAnd the issue was \nstill the same over half a century later in Kepler's defence of \nTycho Brahe against his critics and above all, almost a century \nlRter in the conflict between Galileo and Cardinal Belarmine, re-\npresenting the Pope and the Inquisition. \nThe conflict was due \nentirely to Galileo's refusal to accept the view that the helio-\ncentric system was merely a convenient hypothesis, and not a state-\nment of fact, \nIt is strange, that about the turn of the last century \nthe modern criticism of science initiated by Ernst Mach and vigo-\nrcuRly supported by Henri Poincare, could coolly declare that the \ncloim l'lhich Copernicus, Kepler and Galileo so bitterly defended \nwas in fact illusory. They taught that science consists in estab-\nlishing functional relations between facts and that anything that \ngoes beyond this is undemonstrable. \nTo speak of a reality under-\nlying these relations was a metaphysical statement, without sub-\nstantial content and irrelevant to science. \nDuring the past half century these earlier statements of \npositivism have been first sharpened into logical positivism and \nthen toned down again by various qualifications which so far as I \ncan see give up any attempt at defining the nature and justification \nof natural science. \nThere has bsen sharp opposition to the posi-\ntivist movement by individual writers, particularly the recently \ndeceased great historian of science, Alexandre Koyre, supported \nup to a point by Margenau and Gerald Holton. \nBut I see no recog-\nnition of the fact, which I propose to tell you about in these \nlectures, that the great achievement of the Copernican revolution \n. \nwas that it established the true metaphysical foundations of science, \non which modern science still rests. \n* \nI shall try to explain what made Copernicus feel that the \nnew system he proposed was real. \nFor this purpose, I shall give \nyou the simplest possible image of a particular feature of the old \nsystem and a greatly simplified version of the way the new system \ndealt with the same subject. \nWhen you watch the position of a planet from a point in the \nnorthern hemisphere, you see its position shifting night after night \nthrough the firmament of fixed stars. It moves predominantly from \nwest to east; \nbut not steadily; it speeds up, slows down, even \nretraces its steps and the'' continues eastwards again. \nIt passes \nthrough these retrogressions at regular intervals. \nThe Ptolemaic \nsystem explained these retrogressions by assuming that the planet \ninstead of circling round its orbit is carried round it sitting \non the edge of a wheel. \nWhile this wheel circles round planet's \norbit, it keeps turning round its axle and produces thereby loops \nin the planet's motion round its orbit. \nThese loops are seen from \nthe earth as retrogressions. \nSuch wheels are known as epicycles, \nand the particular type I am describing are the major epicycles. \nThe effect of epicyclical motion can be understood best by assuming \nthat the planet has for the moment discontinued its main eastward \nmotion around its orbit. Viewed from the earth at rest, the image \nof the planet among the fixed stars will oscillate then at the \nrate of its passage around the epicycle. \nAdd then to the oscil-\nlation once more the orbital motion to the east and you obtain the \nretrogression or looping as observed from the earth. \nThe fundamental idea of Copernicus was that instead of \nhaving the planets circling on epicyclical wheels, we can get the \nsame effect by putting the earth into a circular motion round the \nsun. \nYou can see how this works if you imagine once more a planet \narrested in its orbital motion and trace then its image in the \nfirmament of stars. \nThe image oscillates in the same way as the \nplanet was seen to oscillate in the Ptolemaic system. \nAnd if we \nadd once more to this oscillation the eastward orbital motion of \n/ \nthe planet, we get the observed looping explained. It is explained \n/ \nnow as a mere illusion, without any epicyclical motion. \nI will invite you now to put yourself mentally into the \nposition of the thirteen centuries preceding Copernicus. \nThough \nit is not easy to find indications of this in the writings of this \nf-\"' \nage, I feel sure that astronomers has noticed two things about \nthe epicycles. \nli'ir~t, all the wheels representing epicycles were \nseen to go round at the same rate and this period was equal to one \nyear. \nIn consequence of this a planet like Mars, circling its \norbit in about two years passes through two loops a year, while \nJupiter which rounds its orbit in 12 years passes through 12 loops \nand Saturn which takes 30 years to go round makes 30 loops on the \nway. \nSecond, the apparent size of the wheels representing the \nobserved loops was observed steadily to decrease with the increas-\ning length of orbital periods from Mars, through Jupiter, to Saturn. \nMoreover it seemed reasonable to assume that all the planets move \nabout the same speed and that if some take longer to go round their \norbit, this is because their orbital circles are larger. \nSo the \norbit of Saturn must be largest, Jupiter have a smaller orbit and \nMars' orbit must be smaller still. \nYou will now see that all three features of the old system \nfollow from the Copernican theory. \nIn the first place, it is ob-\nvious that, since epicycles are replaced by an illusory oscillation \ndue to the annual motion of the earth round the sun, this osciJla-\ntion must always take place at the same rate, equalling one year. \nThe second point, the difference in the angle of oscillations, arises \nnow by placing the several planets at different distances from the \nearth. \nIndeed, in order to explain any particular angle of oscil-\nlation,~~ place the planet at a definite distance. \nIn other \nwords, the theory fixes the solar distance of each planet in pro-\nportion to the solar distance of the earth, and this yields our \n_!hird QQint: It confirms the ancient surmise, that the size of \nplanetary orbits gets steadily larger as the orbital period gets \nlonger. \nSuch was thetriumph of Copernicus. \nThe major epicycles \nwere wiped out as illusory. \nThe equality of their periods and the \nfact that they equal one year is deduced and the fact that the \nangle of oscillation of the planetary loops decreases as the \nperiod of orbital period increases is accounted for by placing \nthe several planets at appropriate distances as a result of which \nwe obtain a sequence of solar distances which increases with the \norbital periods, as had always been thought to be reasonable. \nAll \nthis was deduced from the one single idea of placing the sun as \nthe center of the planetary system and moving the earth from the \n* \ncenter into the position of a planet circling round the sun. \nIt is on the $uccess of this fundamental idea, setting \naside the infinite complications of its ultimate execution, that \nCopernicus based his claim that his system was real. \nIn the pre-\nface addressed to Pope Paul III he writes that he has \nat last discovered that, if the motions of'the rest of \nthe planets be brought intb relation with the circulation \nof the Earth and be reckoned in prbportion to the orbit \nof each planet, not only do their phenomena presently \nensue, but the orders and magnitudes of all stars and \nspheres, nay the heavens themselves, become so bound \ntogether that nothing in any part thereof could be \nmoved from its place without producing confusion of all \nthe other parts and of the Universe as a whole. \nEverything is now bound together, he claims, and this is \na sign that the system is real. \nOther passages are more specific, \nbut the analysis I have given is but my own reconstruction of the \nresult Copernicus had in mind, no exact specification of it is given \nin his book. \nHe speaks fervently of the harmonies he has estab-\nlished but gives no precise definition of its claims. \n* \n* \nThis account of the Copernican system is admittedly much abbre-\nviated by disregarding for the moment the two planets Mercury and \nVenus the orbits of which lie inside the orbit of the earth. \nSuffice \nto say, that these fit in with the picture I have given and thus \n~ \nstrengthen further the principles of the Copernican system. \nIt is recorded that Petrarca, living in the neighbourhood \nof Avignon early in the fourteenth century, was one of the first \nmounteneers and climbed the Mont Saint Victoire, famous by Cezanne 1 ll \npainting of it. \nBut so novel was the rapture he felt,that he would \nfind no words for it, though every schoolboy has them ready today. \nFaced with his unprecedented ~chievement of a great sdientific \ndiscovery, Copernicus was incapable of telling clearly what had \ndeeply convinced him. \nBut today it is clear that what he discove-\nred was a coherent image of previously scattered features and this \nwas what convinced him that he was facing the true nature of the \nplanetary system. \nBut why exactly did this claim evoke such protest among \nhis contemporaries, particularly by the clergy? The medieval \nteaching which clerics from Osiander to Belarmin\u00b0defended, goes \nback to Aristotle. It derived all essential features of the uni-\nverse from necessary first principles, such as the perfection of \ncreation. \nFor example, the divine perfection of steady circular \nmotion required., that the course of all heavenly bodies be . con-\nstructed from such motions. \nCopernicus himself insisted on this \nat the cost of introducing absurd complications into his system. \nEven Galileo adhered to it. \nThis view excluded the possibility or \n\u00a3.-or-discovering ultimate features of nature by the empirical ob-\nservations of the astronomer. \nOnly philosophy was competent to \nreach such conclusions. \nCenturies later the positivists declared \nonce more that science can say nothing about ultimate reality, \nbut theirs was a very different reason, namely that any such claim \nwas meaningless. \nTheir purpose was to purify science of such \nempty metaphysical implications. \nThe meaning of these two different attacks on Copernicanism \nthe medieval and the positivist attacks, and the position of Coper-\nnicus himself can be illustrated by a diagram. \nThe medieval posi-\ntion shows reason as conceived by them, bearing directly on reality, \nwhile barring science from any such be~ring. \nThe positivist move-\nment is shown isolating sdience both from basic reason and from \nreality. \nRegarded as a convenient relation of given facts, science \nis self contained. \nCopernicanism is shown, thirdly, claiming to \napply basic reason through empirical science for discovering \nreality. \nCopernicus has made for the first time the metaphysical \nclaim that science can discover new knowledge about fundamental \nre_ality and this claim triumphed in the Copernican revolution. \nLater the claim of science to know reality was disowned by the \npositivist critique of metaphysics; \nI myself agree with Copernicus. \nj In my opinion it is impossible to pursue science without believing \n/ that it can discover reality and I want to re-establish his belief. \nLet us try to understand then what Copernicus believed by \nsaying that his system was real. \nWe shall find a clue to this \nif we first look at a more active form of this belief which Kepler \nand Galileo have manifested when undertaking their enquiries. They \ntestified to their belief that the Copernican system was real, by \nrelying on it as a guide to discovery. \nWe know that this confidence \nproved justified. \nI shall show this for Kepler. \nHis Third Law, \ndiscovered sixty six years after the death of Copernicus, developed \nthe feature of the heliocentric system, which Copernicus mentioned \nas its most striking harmony, namely the fact that all six planets \nrecede steadily further from the sun in the sequence of their \nlonger orbital periods. \nKepler lent precision to this relationship \nby showing that the cube of solar distances is proportional to \nthe square of the orbital periods. \nHis other great discovery, \nmade ten years earlier of his First and Second Laws, was in a \nsense a departure from Copernicus. \nIt broke away from the doctrine \nof steady circular planetary motions and introduced instead an \nelliptic path and a law of variable velocities related to the \n;ellipse. Yet this elliptic path, with the Sun in one focus of it, \n// was firmly tied to the heliocentric system. It could never have \n\\ \nbeen discovered from Ptolemy's image of the planetary system. \nI would not hesitate to say that these discoveries proved \nthe reality of the Copernican system but this is because I know \nwhat Newton discovered towards the end of the same century, namely \nthat these threE!_laws of Kepler were expressions of the law of \nuniversal gravitation. \nAt the time Kepler put his laws forward, \nmixed up with a number of other numerical rules that proved falla-\ncious, the effect of his three laws was not widely convincing; \nGalileo himself was unimpressed by them. \nBut for the moment I can \nset this aside, for I am only trying to understand what Kepler and \nGalileo believed about the Copernican system, when they relied \n/ \non their conviction that it was real and therefore a proper guide \n\\ \nto their enquiries. \nIn a sense it is easy to see what happened in Kepler's \nand Galileo's thought, \nRelying on the reality of the Copernican \nsystem, they recognised the presence of problems, which after many \nyears were to prove fruitful. \nBut how did the Copernican system \nindicate to them good problems that where not visible in the \nPtolemaic system? \nThis raises a general question, which to my knowledge, \nhas never been systematically examined, \nThe question is'l \nWhat is \na problem? \nNot the kind of problem set to students of mathematics \nor to chemists in practical classes but a scientific problem the \nsolution of which is unknown; \nand yet a problem the scientist \nmay embark on with a reasonable hope to discover something new \nthat will be worth the 1kbour and expenses of the search for it, \nI would answer that to have such a problem, a good problem \nis to surmise the presence of something hidden, and yet possibly \naccessible, lying in a certain direction. Enquiry stats with such \na vague surmise and it may still remain uncertain to the end what \nexactly might be discovered by its pursuit. \nSuch a problem is \nevoked in the imagination of a scientist by a set of circumstances \nwhich he recognises as clues to something hidden. \nAnd when the \nproblem is solved these clues will be seen to form part of the \nhidden thing thus discovered. \nThe clues of a problem thus anti-\ncipate aspects of a future discovery and guide the questing mind \nto make the discovery. \nWe can say then that Kepler's feeling that the Copernican \nsystem was real, was expressed by his belief that its image \nanticipated aspects of something still hidden, that might be \naccessible by research in certain directions. \nAnd we may add, \nthat Kepler's discoveries similarly raised problems in Newton's \nmind by the fact that Kepler's laws anticipated aspects of the still \nhidden laws of gravitation, which Newton was to discover. \nThus \nNewton too was guided by a belief in the reality of the Copernican \nsystem. \nThe belief which the followers of Copernicus placed in \nthe reality of the Copernican system consisted then in imputing \nto it still hidden implications, vaguely suggested by the presence \nof possible anticipations sensed in certain features of the system. \nTheir belief in its reality was a feat of the questing imagination, \nessential to their creative achievement. \n* \nLet us take stock of the position we have reached. \nIn the \nhistory of the Copernican Revolution we have found it possible to \ndiscriminate the explicit statements of the theory from its anti-\ncipatory powers. \nThe celestial time-table set out by Copernicus \nwas not markedly different from that of Ptolemy. \nClose on to a \ncentury following the death of Copernicue, all efforts to discri-\nminate convincingly between the two systems on the grounds of their \nobservable quantitative predictions have failed. \nWhile the dis-\ncoveries of Kepler and Galileo based on the heliocentric system \ngreatly increased its plausibility and eventually convinced most \nastronomers, the general effect, judged for example by the re-\nsponses of Bacon and Milton, was not conclusive. \nYet all this \ntime the theory of Copernicus was exercising heuristic powers to-\ntally absent in the system of Ptolemy. \nWe are faced there with \nthe question how one of two theoretical systems, having the same \nexplicit content, can vastly exceed the other in its anticipations. \nThe answer is there already in my description of the anti-\ncipatory suggestions offered by the Copernican system. \nIts anti-\ncipatory powers lay in the new image by which Copernicus repre-\nsented the predictive content of the Ptolemaic system. \nIt is in \nthe al?peardnce of the new system that lay its immense superiority; \nit is this image that made the Copernican revolution. \nI am drawing here a distinction which will prove decisive. \nI distinguish between the precise predictive content of a mathe-\nmatical theory consisting in a functional relation of measured \nvariables and a meaning of the theory which goes beyond this. \nWhile \nthese functional relations remain the same, the surplus of meaning \nwhich goes beyond them may vary with the appearance of the theory. \nThe way this may come about can be illustrated from every-\nday life. Suppose we have a list of all the towns of England, each \nwith its precise longitude and latitude, and the number of its in-\nhabitants and we now represent these data in a map, each town being \nmarked by a circle corresponding to it in size. \nThe mapping of \nthe list adds no new data to it, yet it conveys a far deeper under-\nstanding of these data. !t reveals for example the way the popula-\ntion is distributed through the country and suggests questions about \nthe reasons of physical geography and history which will account for \nthis distribution. \nThe map will guide the imagination to enter on \nfruitful enquiries to which the original list would leave us blind. \nE.

Foster has shown a similar difference between two \nkinds of characters in a novel. \nThere are flat characters whose \nbehavior can be precisely predicted and round characters which \ndevelop creatively; \nthe latter are more real and hence have the \npower. convincingly to surprise us. \nBy bearing on reality, scien-\ntific theories also have the power convincingly to surprise us. \nBut before going further, I must yet enter a caveat. \nThe \ndistinction between explicit content and informal heuristic powers \nis profound, but not absolute. \nNo mathematical theory means any-\nthing except as understood by him who applies it, and such an act \nof understanding and applying is no explicit operation; it is \nnecessarily informal. \nGreat discoveries have indeed been made by \nmerely finding novel instances to which an accepted theory applies. \nVant' Hoff's discovery that the mass action law of chemistry was \nan instance of the Second Law of thermodynamics was a fundamental \nachievement. \nWhen I speak of the explicit content of a theory, I refer \nto such applications of it which, though informal, are fairly obviouF \nThese I distinguish from the yet indeterminate meaning of the theory \nthat may be revealed only much later, by a creative act of a \nscientist's imagination. \nThis type of discovery is also based on \na firm belief in the bearing which an accepted theory has on reality. \nBut was Copernicus himself, when expressing his belief in \nthe reality of his system, in fact asserting that it had anticipa-\ntory powers, which the Ptolemaic system had not? It is not clear \nhow anticipatory powers can be known at all, except in the act of \nrelying on them as clues to an enquiry. \nCopernicus certainly did \nnot know that his system represented an aspect of Kepler's laws \nand of Newton's theory of general gravitation. \nIndeed, being \nwedded to an explanation of the planetary system in terms of steady \ncircular motions, he would have absolutely rejected Kepler's Law \nand Newton's theory based on them. \nYet his belief that his system was real, was basically akin \nto that of his great successors. \nFor he based his claim on those \nfeatures of his system which were to serve as clues to the problems \nof Kepler and Newton. \nHe cited in its favour the regular increase \nof orbital periods with increasing distance from the sun and also \nthe position of the sun at the center controlling the whole order \nof planets. \nBut there is a more general kinship between the commitment \nof Copernicus to his belief that his system was real and that of \nhis followers who relied on it for their problems. \nWhat Copernicus \nbelieved of his system, certainly included what we commonly mean \nby saying that a thing is real and not a mere figment of the mind. \nWe mean then that the thing will not dissolve like a dream, but \nthat, in one way or another it will yet manifest its existence \ninexhaustibly in the future, \nIt is there, whether we believe it \nor not, persisting independently of us, and hence never fully \npredictable in its consequences. \nThe anticipatory powers which \nKepler, Galileo and Newton revealed in the heliocentric system, \nwere but more precise details of the general anticipations that \nare intrinsic to any belief in reality. \nWe may indeed define reality and truth as follows. \nIf \nanything is believed to be capable of a largely indeterminate \nrange of future manifestations, it is thus believed to be real. \nA statement about nature is believed to be true if it is believed \nto disclose an aspect of something real in nature. \nA true physi-\ncal theory is, therefore, no mere functional relation between ob-\nserved facts, but represents an aspect of reality, which may yet \nmanifest itself inexhaustibly in the future. \nBut we must yet explain the fact that the general appearance \nof the Heliocentric system made Copernicus and his followers be-\nlieve that it was real. It was its close coherence, its intellec-\ntual harmonies that had this power over them. \nFor the existence of a harmonious order is a denial of \nrandomness; \norder and randomness are mutually exclusive. \nAnd \nwe may add that anything that is random is meaningless, while \nanything that is orderly is meaningful. \nTake the difference between a tune and a noise; \nor, more \ngenerally, between a message and a noise. \nCommunication theory \ndefines a noise, by contrast to any distinctive series of signals, \nas a random sequence and it says that, as such, noise conveys no \ninformation - means nothing. \nNote also an important difference in the identifiability \nof an ordered sequence, as compared with a noise. \nAny single \nmessage is represented ideally by only one configuration of signals, \n\n- 15 ~ \nwhile for a noise the very opposite holds. \nNo significance must \nbe attached to any particular configuration of signals that are \na noise. \nWe must indiscriminately identify any particular configu-\nration of a noise with any other configuration of it. And this \nis true of any random aggregate! \nthe chance events which compose \nit could have as well happened otherwise. \nBy contrast, once we \nhave recognised an aggregate of events as orderly and meaningful, \nwe do not think that they might just as well have happened diffe-\nrently. \nSuch an aggregate is deemed an identifiable thing, posses-\nsing reality in the sense I have defined it; \nnamely, that it may \nyet manifest itself inexhaustibly in the future, \nTo distinguish \nmeaningful patterns from random aggregates is therefore to exer-\ncise our power for recognising reality. \nOur capacity for discerning meaningful aggregates, as \ndistinct from chance aggregates, is an ultimate power of our per-\nsonal judgment. \nIt can be aided by explicit argument but never \ndetermined by it: our final decision will always remain tacit. \nSuch a distinction may be so obvious, that our tacit powers are \nused effortlessly and their use remain unnoticed. \nOur eyes and ears \ncontinuously commit us to such decisions automatically. \nBut other \ndecisions of this kind may be hard and momentous. \nA jury may be \npresented with a pattern of circumstantial evidence pointing to the \naccused. \nIt is always conceivable that this pattern may be due to \nchance. \nHow unlikely a chance should they admit to be possible? Or \nelse, what degree of coincidence should be deemed quite unbelievable? \nThe prisoner's life and the administration of justice will depend \non the decision, and there is no rule by which it can be decided. \nI have said that reality in nature is a thing that persists \nand may yet manifest itself unexhaustibly, far beyond our present \nken. \nSomething must be added to this description, if the pursuit \nof natural science is to be justified. Consider that the Coper-\nnican revolution w~s but a continuation of a structuring that had \nits origins in antiquity. \nCopernicus deepened and beautifully \nclarified a coherence transmitted by Ptolemy. \nAnd this triumph \npointed beyond itself in the mind of Copernicus himself, \nIn Kepler, \npassionately embracing the system bf Copernicus, its image evoked \nanew the same kind of creative hunger which Copernicus had satis-\nfied by discovering it. \nAnd the presence of yet hidden truth worked \nits way ever further. \nTo Newton, Kepler's three laws appeared to \nhang together and he established this by his theory of gravitation \nwhich jointly derived them from the mechanics of Galileo. \nNor \nwas this the end, for a quarter of a millennium later, Einstein was \nto find unsatisfying the relation of the Newtonian system to the \nelectromagnetic theory of light and was to discover an even deeper \ncoherence to reconcile the two. \nThe continued pursuit ofscience is possible, because the \nstructure of nature and the capacity of the human mind to grasp \nthis structure, can be such as is exemplified by this sequence of \ndiscoveries during the past two thousand years. \nIt is frequently \nthe case, that nature is capable of being grasped in successive \nstages, each of which can be reached only by the highest powers of \nthe human mind. \nConsequently, to discover a true coherence in \nnature is often not only to discern something which, by the mere \nfact of being real, necessarily points beyond itself, but to surmise \nthat future discoveries may prove its reality to be far deeper than \nwe can imagine at present. \n* \nIt may sound strange that I insist on a belief in the \nreality of theoretical suppositions as the driving force to dis-\ncovery. \nSuch belief would seem a conservative assumption, rather \nthan a source of innovation. \nThe positivist view of science would \nindeed claim that the major discoveries of modern physics were \nbased on a sceptical a;ttitude towards the framework of hitherto \naccepted scientific theories. \nThe discovery of relativity involved \nthe abandonment of the current conceptions of space and time, and \nquantum mechanics achieved its breakthrough by discarding the \nplanetary system of electrons circling the nucleus, from which \nNiels Bohr had derived the theory of atomic spectra. Einstein him-\nself acknowledged that Mach's positivist philosophy had inspired \nhis work and Heisenberg's quantum mechanics was deliberately framed \nto reduce atomic theory to a functional relation of observable \nquantities. \nThese facts may seem to contradict my thesis, but I think \nthey will fall in line with it, if I first make clearer the oppo-\nsite extreme of creative procedure, based on a \nre11lity of the current framework of scientific \n' \nftrm belief in the \n' \ntheory. \nWe may \nrecognise the prototype of such a feat in the discovery of America \nby Columbus. \n:'t.....-\nHe triumphed by taking literally, and as,'guide to \n,, \naction, that the earth was round which his contemporaries held \nvaguely and as a mere matter of speculation. \nThe egg of Columbus \nis the proverbial symbol for such breath-taking originality guided \nby a crudely concrete imagination. \nI remember having the same \nfeeling when first hearing of Einstein's theory of Brownian motion. \nThe idea that the meandering oscillations of small floating particles \nseen under the miscroscope, should reveal the impact of molecules \nhitting them in accordance with the speculative equations of the \nkinetic theory of gases, impressed me as grossly incongruous. \nI \nhad the same feeling of something fantastic, when I heard Elsasser \nsuggesting (in 1925) that certain anomalies observed in the scat-\ntering of electrons by solids may be due to the optical interference \nof their de Broglie waves. \nWe had all heard of these waves since \n1923, yet were astounded by the fact that they could be taken \nliterally as Elsasser did. \nThis may remind us that the first great move towards the \ndiscovery of quantum mechanics was de Broglie's idea of the wave \nnature of matter. \nThis revolutionary idea and Schrodinger's deve-\nlopment of it into wave mechanics, shows no trace of any positivistic \ninfluences. \nAdd to this, that Max Planck, the founder of quantum \ntheory, actively opposed Mach's analysis of science and dissented \nfrom Heisenberg's claim of basing physical theories on directly \nobservable ~uantities, 1 and that Einstein himself, whose principle \nof relativity served as an inspiration to modern positivism, was \n2 \n/Sharply critical of it. \nIt appears then, that the pre-dominant \n/ \n./ principle that shaped modern physical theory was not the positivist \n, program, but the transition from a mechanical conception of reality \nto a mathematical conception of it, which sometimes coincided with \npositivistic aims. \nWe can bring thus the revolution of the twentieth century \ninto line with the Copernican revolution of the 16th and 17th century. \nThey both consisted in a stepwise deepening of coherence with a \n( \nsimultaneous extension of its range. \nThe modern revolution differed \nfrom its precursor in establishing mathematical harmonies in place \nof beautiful mechanical systems. \nThe mathematical image of reality is more abstract than the \nmechanical, but its capacity to point beyond its immediate predictive \ncontent is similar to that of the mechanical image. \nI have said \nthat the fact that the wave nature of particles postulated by de \nBroglie could be confirmed by diffraction experiments, came as a \nfantastic surprise to physicists. \nThe discovery of the positron \ncame about just as unexpectedly to confirm a prediction contained \nunnoticed in Dirac's quantum theory of the electron (192$). \nIn my account of the Copernican revolution and of the \nmodern revolution in physics, I have mentioned only in passing the \ncontributions made by new experimental observations. \nBut the example~ \nI gave were typical of the way at this time experiments followed \ntheir theoretical anticipation, the connection being often not recog-\nnized at first. Theoretical speculation and experimental probing \nentered jointly into a persistent quest towards an ever broader \nand deeper coherence. \n* \nThis remark brings up the question, how the actual process \nof discovery is performed, \nMuch has been written about this with \nwhich I disagree, but for the moment I can put my own views only \nquite summarily. \nTo see a good problem is to see something hidden \nand yet accessible. \nThis is done by integrating some raw experiences \ninto clues pointing to a possible gap in our knowledge. \nTo under-\ntake a problem is to commit one-self to the(:,J:>eli\\f that you can fill \nin this gap and make thereby a new_contact with reality. \nSuch a \ncommitment must be passionate; \na problem which does not worry us, \nthat does not excite us, is not a problem; it does not exist. With-\nout such passionate commitment no supporting evidence will turn up, \nno failure to find such evidence will be felt, no conclusions will \nbe drawn and tested, no quest will take place. \nEvidence is cast \nup only by a surmise, a hope of the truth which as such, necessar-\nily seeks its own fulfilment. \nThis is how the anticipatory powers \nI have shown at work in a historical perspective, arouse and guide \nindividual creativity. \nIn these lectures I want to define the mental powers by which \n----~----\ncoherence is discovered in nature. \nThis will establish the theore-\ntical grounds of scientific enquiry, guided by anticipations of \nreality. \n* \nBut this is not enough. \nThe triumph of coherence achieved \nby the Copernican Revolution filled those brought up on the Medieval \norder of the universe with dismay. \nThe earth's central position \nwhich had been the symbol of man's destiny as the only thinking \nmorally responsible being, was lost. \nGone was the divine perfec-\ntion of an immutable firmament encircling the place where fallen \nman was ever to strive for salvation beyond this place. \"It is all \nin pieces, all coherence gone\", wrote John Donne already in 1611. \nThe destruction was deepened by the revival of atomism. \nDante had said of Democritos that he \"abandoned the world to chance.\" \nAnd Dante was right. \nThe assumption that all things are ultimately \ncontrolled by the same laws of atomic interaction, reduces all forms \nof existence to accidental collocations of ultimate particles. \nThere \nare then no essentially higher things, and no __ !11tangible things can \nbe real. \nTo understand the world consists then in representing \nthroughout all that is of greater significance in terms of its less \n_,/ \nmeaningful elements and if possible, in terms of meaningless matter. \nAccepting this conception of truth and reality man feels himself \n\n{ \nI \nf \nmenaced by his own lucidity and blighted by self-doubt. \nThe positivist critique of science marks the stage at which \nthe false idea of truth and reality attacks science itself, from \nwhich it had originated. If we can overcome these false ideals \nat this point, this might set an example for our whole outlook \nand, backed by the very prestige of sciencej help to overcome \nscientism everywhere. \n* \nThe recognition of anticipatory powers in science has \nalready supplied us with a conception of reality, which transcends \nthe tangible substratum of things. \nThis will allow us to acknow-\nledge higher entities, intangible and yet more real than matter. \nWe shall recognise a hierarchy of being in which man recovers his \nproper place. \nHe may then feel at home again in the universe.",

    "content_html": "<p>J Lecture 2 The Structure of Tacit Knowing. by i&#x27;lichael Polanyi (Delivered at Wesleyan University, October 14, 1965) In my last talk I alluded to the powers of the mind by which we establish coherence in nature: a cbherence which reveals the presence of something real in nature. I said that coherence is often automatically recognised by our eyes and ears, but that such deeply hidden coherence as natural science seeks to discover, is grasped only by a creative act of the imagination. I have said that there is no strict rule by which to distinguish a true coherence that has an important meaning, from an accidental coherence that means nothing. Tonight I want to tell you of these mental powers, which operating without strict rules, enable us to pursue scientific enquiries and to establish their result to be true. I shall speak of these faculties in broad terms tonight, in the hope of explaining in a week&#x27;s time in greater detail how they actually carry out the task of scientific discovery. * When I point my finger at the wall and call out: &#x27;Look at this!&#x27; all eyes turn to the wall, away from my finger. You are clearly attending to my pointing finger, but only in order to look at something else, namely at the point to which my finger is directing your attention. We have here two different ways of being aware of things. One way is to look at a thing. This is the way you look at the wall. But how is one to describe the way you see my finger pointing at the wall? You are not looking at my finger, but away from it. I should say that you do not see it as a mere object, to be examined as such, but as an object having a function, the function of directing your attention away from itself and at something else. But this is not to say that my pointing finger was trying to make you disregard itself. Far from it. It wanted to be seen, but to be seen only in order to be followed and not in order to be examined. I shall call my pointing finger a subsidiary thing or an instrumental thing that functions by pointing at an object which is at the focus of our attention. And I suggest that we have here two different kinds of awareness. We are subsidiarily aware of the pointing finger and focally aware of the object that it points at. We establish an integrated relationship between them by recognising the direction in which the finger directs us and by following this direction, This relationship is not symmetrical. The finger points at the wall, but the wall does not point at the finger. The rela- tionship that we have established has an intrinsic direction, it is directive. Thus the finger has a meaning that the wall lacks. It can raise a problem; if you come across a pointing finger by itself in a wood, it makes you wonder what it may be pointing at. This shows that it is for us to establish the coherence of the pointing finger with that which it points at. It is for us to comprehend the coherent system connecting a subsidiary element with the focal point on which the subsidiary element bears. And note that we perform this comprehending without a word. No syllogism is set up, no evidence is cited. The performance is tacit, and since its result is valid, we may call it an act of tacit inference. Another case of this kind - to be found at the bottom of the table - will reinforce this analysis and develop\u00a2 it further. Think of a pair of stereoscopic photographs, viewed in the proper way, one eye looking at one, the other eye at the other. The objects shown in the two pictures appear in their joint image as distributed in depth, hard and tangible. This is what we see at the focus of our eyes, but it involves also the sight of the two component pictures: cover these up and we see nothing at all. But we do not see these two pictures in themselves. In a way we look through them or from them to their joint image. So I shall class our awareness of them as subsidiary and observe that the way we look at them integrates their sights into the spacially deepened image to which they contribute. Thanks to our integration the two flat pictures effectively function as clues to a spacial image. We may say that this image is their joint meaning and that this joint meaning lies in the focus of our attention. So far the structure of this tacit integration is analogous to that of a finger pointing at an object. But something important is added here. The joint meaning of the subsidiaries is expressed in a new sensory quality. Sights in depth have come about by integrating sights that were comparatively flat. This change of appearance is in fact a regular accompani- ment of tacit integration. A pointing finger also looks a little different than the finger fixed in the same position by arthritis. This kind of difference is more noticeable in the closely analogous case of a word denoting an object. The word when functioning in this way appears transparent, by contrast to its opaque appearance, when we listen to it as a sequence of sounds. I shall come back to</p>\n<p>4 - this later. The functions of the subsidiaries, which brings out their joint meaning,will be seen usually expressed in a novel appearance. Professor Hadley Cantril of Princeton has shown that when we introduce two fairly disparate pictures into the stereoscope, we see fanciful integrations of them. Such images are illusory. But we may limit ourselves to the case that the two pictures viewed are proper photographs and th~t hence their stereoscoping image is a reasonably correct evaluation of their joint meaning, We can then regard stereoscopic viewing as a feat of tacit inference in analogy to a process of explicit inference. But let me stop to warn here from a misconception. It is a mistake to identify subsidiary awareness with sub-conscious or pre-conscious awareness, or with the fringe of consciousness des- ,cribed by William James. The relation of subsidiaries to that on / which they bear is a logical relation similar to that which a premiss has to the inference drawn from it, with the great difference, that the inferences arrived at here are tacit, Subsidiary awareness can be fully conscious, as that of a pointing finger or a pair of pictures viewed in the stereoscope, though in other cases our consciousness of subsidiaries may be on a very low level and may be altogether subliminal. As we touch upon the several examples in the table we shall meet with every level of consciousness among the subsidiaries. These variations in their level of consciousness in no way affect their functions as subsidiary elements of an act of tacit knowing. Jean Piaget has strikingly contrasted the act of acquiring knowledge by a sensory act like perception as compared with a process of explicit inference. He points out that explicit inference, is Table to page 4: Tacit Knowing: From subsidiaries by integrating them we focus at finger pointing at an object name designating a person features forming a physiognomy motions combined to skilled action probe exploring a cavity sensory clues combined to a percept factual clues leading to a discovery stereo pictures viewed as a stereo image reve_\u00a3sible in the sense that we can go back to its premisses and go forward again to its conclusions, as often ffS we like, while this is not tr&gt;ue for the sensory act. And since perception is always combined with action and action with sensation, Piaget contrasts all sensorimotor acts with explicit inferences and calls them irreversible All acts of tacit integration are irreversible, and this can be understood from the structure of tacit knowing. We find indeed that tacit knowing can have two kinds of irreversibility. One consists in the fact that we may not be able to identify all the clues which we have integrated in establishing their joint meaning. The other kind of irreversibility goes beyond this. It is due to the fact that when wi shift the focus of our attention from the meaningful result of tacit integration, and focus on the subsidiaries, their integration is wiped out. The subsidiary particulars cease to have a bearing on their prospective target and are reduced to an aggregate of meaningless objects. The first kind of irreversibility can be ~ contingent, by contrast to the second, that is logically necessary. The joint viewing of two stereoscopic photographs offers a simple example both of contingent and logical irreversibility. ,, Think of the differences in the two pictures, by virtue of which their joint viewing offers the sight of spacial depth: these dif- ferences are very small and are scattered all over the pictures. It is almost impossible to identify them, they are virtually un- specifiable. This is the first kind of irreversibility. But even if we could overcome this and identify the clues of stereoscopic vision it would not be the same as retracing the steps of a mathe- matical proof. To reconsider a mathematical deduction, is to deepen our understanding of the idea which it embodies. We can see now in the premises the whole panorama of their implications. By contrast, if we take out the stereo pictures from the viewer and look at them separately, the cease to tell us anything of what they jointly mean, we see nothing of what they would jointly present to our eyes. To go back to the antecedents of our tacit inference, has not deepened our grasp of its result, but has made us lose sight of it. You can verify this in all the instances of tacit knowing listed in the table. I have mentioned already in passing the most widely known example of this disintegration of meaning, caused by the shifting of our focal attention to that which has this meaning. A spoken word loses its meaning if we repeat it a number of times, while carefully attending to the movement of our lips and tongue and to the sound we are making. These actions were meaningful, so long as we attended to that on which they jointly bear and lost their meaning when we shifted our attention to them. It is also well known that we tend to lose control of the motions forming a skilful performance, if we attend to them closely. The famous tight-rope walker, Blondin, says in his memoirs that he would instantly lose his balance if he thought directly of keeping it; he must force himself to think only of the way he would eventually descend from the rope. Admittedly, the disintegration of tacit knowledge by shifting our attention to its clues is not irreparable. The two stereo pictures can be viewed once more jointly; the word that lost its meaning will regain it if we once more use it, once more subsi- diarly be casting our mind forward to something we can say by it. The paralysis of a skill, due to switching our attention to the motions that compose its performance, can be remedied by attendi~g once more to the purpose which our co-ordinated motions are to serve. But it is important to note that this recovery never brings back the original meaning. It may improve on it. Motion studies, which tend to paralyse a skill, will improve it when followed by practice. The meticulous dismembering of a text which can kill its appreciation can also supply material for a much deeper understanding of it. In these cases, the detailing of particulars, which, by itself, would destroy meaning, serves as a guide to their subsequent integration and thus establishes a more secure and more accurate meaning of them. But the damage done by the specification of particulars may be irremediable. Meticulous detailing may obscure beyond recall a subject like history, literature or philosophy. In his essay on the Name and Nature of Poetry A. E. Housman has described the dis- astrous effect of spelling out in detail the allusions of Edgar Poe 1, in his poem The Haunted Palace. My former colleague at Manchester the distinguished French scholar Mansell Jones has written that the humanities are discredited and rejected because of their unconscious abuse of eructation in the teaching of humane subjects. &quot;Research - he wrote - is at once the flower and the virus of Arts.&quot; But it is not the unintentional damage done to our tacit knowledge, by reducing our capacity to re-integrate its subsidiaries after having brought them to the light of focal consciousness, that is the main issue here; it is a deliberate refusal to rely on the tacit mode of integration. The modern mind refuses to accept the necessity for tacit assumptions and wants to keep the grounds of its beliefs clearly in focus, as one does in an explicit deduction. Our whole culture is pervaded by the resolve to avoid unspecifiable commitments and to get down ruthlessly to the hard facts of this world and to keep our eyes firmly fixed on them. This is true above all for science. It was science that originated this spirit of ruthless enquiry and in the twentieth century science itself was subjected to this enquiry, demanding strict methods of research and, above all, strict criteria of meaning and truth in science. Science shall remain my main example for the * &quot;The Haunted Palace is one of Poe&#x27;s best poems so long as we are content to swim in the sensations it evokes and only vaguely to apprehend the allegory. We are roused to discomfort, at least I am, when we begin to perceive how exact in detail the allegory is; when it dawns upon us that the fai.r palace door is Roderick Usher&#x27;s mouth, the pearl and ruby his teeth and lips, the yellow banners his hair, the ramparts plumed and pallid his forehead, and when we are reduced to hoping, for i.t is no more than a hope, that the winged odours have no connexion with hair-oil.&quot; A.

The conception of_ science as a precise relationship of facts open to public inspection implies that facts are definite and&#x27;specifiable, that they are neither more nor less than what their designation tells. Thia I shall contest. Last time I have shown that true science bears on reality and, in doing so, carries with it the expectation of yet unknown future implications; now I shall amplify the conception of scientific truth at the other end: not in its anticipations, but in its foundations, We shall find that at the source of his knowledge too, the scientist knows far more than he can tell, There is an entry in my table which speaks of features forming a physiognomy. These subsidiary items seem even more diffi- cult to identify than were the subsidiaries in the pair of stereo- photographs. Shall we take it that we can actually know-that is, know subsidarily - far more than we can tell? Let us look into this. It is a fact that we can know a person&#x27;s face and recognise him among a thousand, indeed among a million, yet usually cannot tell how we recognise a face we know. And we have many other in- stances of the recognition of a characteristic appearance in science itself, which have the same structure as the identification of a person. At the universities great efforts are spent in practical classes to teach students to identify cases of diseases and specimens of rocks, plants and animals. All descriptive sciences study such physiognomies which cannot be fully described in words, nor even by pictures. All this practical teaching must rely on the intelligent pupil&#x27;s capacity to recognise the relevant particulars of a physiog- nomy and their characteristic relationship in the physiognomy. It relies also on it that he acquires a skill in testing, which entails a combination of motions which will remain unspecifiable. But can it not be argued that the possibility of teaching the recognition of characteristic appearances proves that we can tell what we know of them? No, what the pupil must discover for himself by trial and error is - even though he be guided by our advice and example - something we could not tell him. The way this happens will become clearer from some fairly recent work in experimental psychology, which has developed a method for studying the elementary act on which all tacit knowing is based. I am referring to the phenomenon called subception, which was first definitely observed and named subception by Lazarus and McCleary in +949, They presented a subject a large number of nonsense syllables, and after showing him certain of the syllables, they administered an electric shock to him. Presently the subject showed symptoms of anticipating the shock at the sight of &quot;shock syllables&quot;; yet, on questioning, he could not identify them. He had come to know when to expect a shock, but he could not tell what made him expect it. He had acquired a knowledge similar to that which we have when we know a person by signs which we cannot tell. Another variant of this phenomenon was demonstrated by Erikson and Kuethe in 1956. They exposed a person to shock whenever he happened to utter associations to certain &#x27;shock words&#x27;. Soon the person learned to forestall the shock by avoiding the utterance of such associations but, on questioning, it appeared that he did not know he was doing this. Here the subject invented a practical operation, but could not tell how he worked it. This kind of sub- ception has the structure of a skill, for a skill combines elementary muscular acts which are not identifiable. The analysis of subception wards off the suspicion of self-contradiction, which may arise in other cases when anyone speaks of things he himself both knows and cannot tell. Subception divides these two functions, so that one person observes that another person has a knowledge that he cannot tell. No one speaks then of a knowledge that he himself has and cannot tell. We can sum up so far as follows. In two experiments, subception was induced by electric shock. In the first series, the subject was shocked after being presented with certain nonsense syllables, and he learnt to expect the shock. In the second series he learnt to suppress the uttering of certain associations which would evoke the shock. In both cases the knowledge of the shock- producing particulars remained unidentifiable, yet the subject relied on his awareness of them for anticipating the shock. He had acquired a subsidiary awareness of these particulars while attending focally to the expectation of a shock; the particulars had become the subsidiary term of a tacit knowledge of which the expectation of the shock was the focal term. The conclusions of Lazarus and icfoCleary have been contested but eventually confirmed by its very critic. Many further experimenti:: have lent support to the effectiveness of this kind of subception. Moreover, a new variant of subception, described by Hefferline in 1959, extended experimental tacit knowing to subliminal stimuli: Hefferline observed that when spontaneous muscular twitches, unfelt by the subject - but observable by a million-fold amplificatioi, of their action currents - were followed by the brief cessation of an unpleasant noise, the subject responded by increasing the frequency of the twitches and thus silencing the noise more frequently.</p>\n<p>I Experiments carried out during the past decade in Soviet Russia have shown this phenomenon in a different manner (Razran 1961). When an internal stimulus which the subject cannot notice in itself - such as the injection of a stream of acidified water in the intesti- nal canal - is repeatedly followed by a punishment, the internal stimulus will come to arouse an expectation of the punishment. More recently, Hefferline produced a new variant of his experiments on subliminal twitches. He succeeded in training sub- jects to press a lever every time a spontaneous twitch occurred in their selected muscle, They had of course no idea what it was they were responding to. It is to thj_s type of. experiments I was referring, when I said at the beginning, that the subsidiary elements of tacit knowing can be on any level of consciousness, from a fully conscious level, down to one far below our powers of apprehension. Remember also that the focal experience arrived at by tacit inference, tells us the meaning of the subsidiaries in terms of a sensation that was not present before. A subliminal event integrated to a focal act or to a focal stimulus produces a maximum degree of phenomenal change. Things that cannot be experienced in themselves at all.act as instruments of conscious performances or else they stimulate conscious actions without being noticed in themselves. There is another point to take up on this occasion. Right at the start, when I pointed at the wall and you looked at j_ t, you integrated the sight of my pointing finger to that which I was pointing at. It is difficult to say where the focal experience, namely the wall with the finger pointing at it, was eventually situated, The stereoscopic viewing of two photographs produced a joint picture of them which was certainly not at the place where the pictures were. In other cases, as in the integration of muscular motions to the performance of a skill, or the integration of features to a physiognomy, the result may be thought to lie about at the same place where the subsidiaries are situated, The Hefferline type of experiments produce integrated events not easily localisable, but certainly not located at the place inside the body where the sub- sidiaries are happening. But there can occur a more definite displac~ment of feelings from where the subsidiaries are first noticed, a displacement which corresponds to a meaningful integration of them. We find this in the way we learn to use a probe for exploring a cavity, or in the way a blind man feels his way by tapping around with a stick. When using a probe for the first time we feel its impact against our fingers and palm. But as we learn to use a probe, or to use a stick for feeling our way, our awareness of its impact on our hand is transformed into a sense of its point touching the objects we are exploring. Thus our integrative effort transposes our meaninglcs~ feelings in:tQ__meaningful ones, and places these at some distance from the original feelings. We become aware of the feelings in our hand in terms of their meaning located at the far end of the probe or stick, to which we are attending. This happens also when we learn to use a tool. We attend to the meaning of its impact on our hands in terms of its effects on the things to which we are applying it and thus make these effects increasingly mea.ningful. It should be clear by now how profoundly the act of tacit integra.tion differs from a process of explicit deduction. To go back to the grounds on which a tacit integration rests, we have not only to contend with its logical irreversibility which blots out the sight of the integrated conclusions the moment we direct our atten- tion to its premises, but - as we have seen - many of these pre- mises may not only be dj_fficult to identify, but be actually not observable in themselves at all. We are far away from the precisely defined and publicly visible evidende required by the ideal of the exact sciences, and indeed from any acknowledged standards of em- pirical evidence, Moreover when we watch how tacit knowing operates on its antecedents, the difference from explicit in_:f&#x27;EJ_rence becomes even more marked. The clues are subjected to an integration which can be carried out only by a private mental act, It is only through our own eyes that the sight of two stereo pictures can be trans- formed into the spacial sight of their content. No manipulation of symbols can perform this act, its quality must be seen to be known, For an integration that yields a meaning links together two kinds of awareness, the subsidiary and the focal, while by contrast, symbols used in an explicit inference can all be put down on a blackboard and be seen there focally by the same kind of awareness. Meaning must therefore be experienced as a sensory quality. Finally, the meaning we arrive at may be something as unsubstantial as the stereoscopic image, or an undefinable human physiognomy, in which we recognise the emotional, intellectual and moral capabilities of a human mind, * We are now ready to take up our central purpose, which is to discern the ,powers by which we recognise coherence in nature, I have to describe now the act of perception more completely. For many years I have pursued the idea that the principles of scientific knowledge and discovery are to be found in the mechanism of per- ception, so I have to describe now the act of perception in the terms of tacit knowing and then generalise the result to the process of scientific discovery. Suppose I look at my right hand. I recognise its area by its closed contours, but if that were all, my hand, when moved about, would keep changing its colour, its shape and its size. The experience of my hand as a solid object, having definite pro- perties, would never asrise. I see it as such, by integration of a host of rapidly changing clues, both in the field of vision and inside my eyes and some still deeper in my body, My powers of recognising coherence makea me see these thousand changing clues jointly, as one single unchanging object moving about at different distances, viewed from different angles, under variable illuminations. A successful integration of innumerable rapidly changing particulars into a single constant sight, makes us recognise that we have a real object before us. It is interesting to note here the stages between things patently real to other things of a more or less dubious reality. Look at a finger of your hand through a pinhole in a sheet of paper, or better still, through a blackened tube, and then move your finger back and forth. You will see it swelling as it approaches your eye and shrinking again when moved away. Psychologists have called this effect a &quot;de-realisation.&quot; The moving object has lost its constant size, for some important clues to its constancy coming from the corner of our eyes have been cut off by the blackened tube. We can say that its coherence having been impoverished, the object&#x27;s reality has become dubious. Taking this little experiment into account, we can note that the integration carried out by our eyes in looking at something, comprises clues at three levels of consciousness. There are the things straight in front of us, seen quite consciously then there are many things seen at the edge of the visual field, which we take in without hardly noticing them, and thirdly there are a great many internal clues, like the contraction of our eye muscles or the changing situation in the cavity of the internal ear, Which we cannot feel in themselves at all, All these experiences function jointly in seeing an object. The way I see my hand moving about in front of me, the distance at which I see it, the shape I see it having, its colour and texture, the speed and direction of its motion, all its sensory qualities, are determined by clues--whether manifest or marginal, or deeply hidden and subliminal--which are integrated into its appearance. The appearance of the object, persistent and real, is the joint meaning of all these subsidiaries. Before passing on from here to the case of scientific knowledge and scientific discovery, I want to mention one more characteristic of tacit_integration to which Conrad Lorenz has called attention. It is speed of such integration. Would we have to note one by one the subsidiary elements for seeing our hand in motion and have to combine them by some explicit operation, most of them would be long since gone before we got round to them. The lightening speed of tacit integration is due to the simple fact that tacit integration handles its clues simultaneously. We can see this at work in the simultaneous coordination of dozens of muscles for the performance of a skill - which is of course an instance of tacit integration. All these features can be recognised in the process of scientific discovery. But I shall speak of this only briefly, because it will be fully treated next week. Let me use a quotation from a text by the English philosopher William Whewell written more than a century ago. In his works I have been happy to find striking anticipations of my own view of science. Speaking of Kepler&#x27;s discovery of the elliptic path of the planet Mars, Whewell wrote: &quot;To hit upon the right conception is a difficult step; and when this step is once made, the facts assume a different aspect from what they had before: that done, they are seen in a new point of view; and the catching this pbint of view, is a special mental operation, requiring special endowments and habits of thought. Befbre this, the facts are seen as detached, separate, lawless; afterwards, they are seen as connected, simple, regular; as parts of one general fact, and thereby possessing innumerable new relations before unseen.&quot; There is no question here of a systematic induction, obser\u2022ring that all A-s are B-s checked by the principles of Agreement and Difference propounded by J. S. Mill at that time and still widely acknowledged to-day. Whewell scathingly attacked tTill a few paragraphs further in the same book. He is very conscious of his own distinctive posi- tion by speaking of discovery as the difficult step of hitting on the right conception of things. He sees it as the catching of a new point of view, in the light of which the facts take on a different appearance. They had previously appeared unrelated, lawless and now they are seen as connected and regular, as parts of a comprehen- sive fact. This is tacit integration as I have described it. And to this Whewell makes a most striking addition. He says that by becoming parts of a comprehensive entity the facts acquire innumerable new relations before unseen. I think he speaks here of the unex- haustible implications I have ascribed to the discovery of a true coherence in nature, the inexhaustible implications arising from the discovery&#x27;s bearing on reality, * I have spoken of perception as an instance of tacit knowing and this amounts to a theory of perception. It says that when light from an object falls into our eyes and our body responds to this in a number of ways, we are aware of these events in terms of seeing the object. We are aware of these internal happenings in terms of the position, size, shape and motion of the object, these sights being the joint meaning of these.internal events, This, I said, goes on according to the principles of tacit_ :integration, that I have illustrated for a number of other instances given in my table. Subsidiaries are brought into operation by virtue of our integrative powers which produce,, their joint meaning, a meaning expressed by an appearance not present in the subsidiaries before, I know that this sounds like the somewhat vague theory of projection, which has been effectively opposed by pointing out that we are not previously aware internally of the sense impressions which we are supposed to project outside. But tacit integration does change the appearance of the subsidiaries in bringing out their joint meaning: Moreover, we have seen experiments by Hefferline and others in which internal events of which we cannot sense in themselves at all can be integrated to the performance of external action. The transposition of feelings in our palm to the far end of a probe when used in exploring a cavity, lends further support to the occurrence of projection as a result of tacit integration. Projection of subsidiary experience to a distante place where it makes sense is clearly established in these cases and authorises in my view my analogous assumption for the interpretation of perception, I would venture, therefore, to extend the scope of tacit knowing to include the neural traces in the cortex of the nervous system. This would place events going on inside our brain on the same footing as the subliminal twitches in Hefferline 1s experiments. The relation of mind and body becomes then an instance of the rela- tion between the two terms of tacit knowing, the subsidiary and the focal, Such a hypothesis does not explain how perceived sights, or any other states of consciousness, arise in conjunction with neural processes. It merely applies the principle that wherever some process in our body gives rise to consciousness in us, our tacit knowing of the process will make sense of it in terms of an experience to which we are attending. This conception of the way the body participates in the act of perception can be generalised to include the bodily roots of all knowledge and thought. It throws light then on the peculiar knowledge we have of our body by living in it, It makes us aware of the fact that our body is the only collection of things which we know almost exclusively by relying on our awareness of them for attending to something else. Our body serves as a tool for ob- serving objects outside us and for manipulating these for purposes of our own. Every time we make sense of the world we rely on our tacit knowledge of impacts that the world makes on our body and of the response of our body to these impacts. Such is the exceptional \u00a3Osition of our body in the universe. I have described how we learn to feel the end of a probe hitting things outside. We may regard this as the transformation of the probe into a sentient extension of our body. But our awareness of our body for attending to things outside it suggests a wider generalisation of the feeling we have of our body. Whenever we are using certain things subsidiarily for attending from them to other things (in the way we usually use our own body) these things change their appearance. They appear to us now in terms of that from which we are attending to them, in the same way as we feel our own body in terms of things outside to which we are attending from our body. In this sense we can say that when we make some things function as the subsidiary term of tacit knowing, we incorporate these things in our body - or extend our body to include them. Let me show you at a glance the wide consequences of this conclusion. We make a thing function as the subsidiary term of a comprehensive entity whenever we see it as part of a whole. We have analysed many instances of this kind: the seeing of a solid body, Kepler&#x27;s discovery of eliptical orbits, the identification of physiognomies, the practice of skills. We could apply our present conclusions to all these, but I want to throw a quick glance over wider fields. Biology studies the shapes of living things and the way they grow into these shapes from germ cells; it describes the organs of living things and explains the way they function; it explores the motor and sensory functions of animals and their intelligent performances. All these are comprehensive entities. Morphology, physiology, animal psychology - they all deal with -comprehensive entities. The only way to know them is to comprehend the coherence of their parts. The structure of tacit knowing re- quires that we make these parts function as subsidiary terms, in the way we make our body function for handling things outside. It requires that, in this sense, we interiorise these things in order to attend f:i:2!!1 them to the comprehensive entiry which they form. We must dwell in them, and not observe them in themselves if we are to be aware of their bearing on the entities to which they belong. Only thus can we understand the way these comprehensive entities rely on their parts for performing their functions. This adds another important feature to the structure of tacit knowing. I look forward to showing you as I go on in these lectures that tacit knowing is ih fact the sovereign instrument for establishing the existence of comprehensive entities and understanding their structure and operations. Note: E. A. Hausmann&#x27;s distinction between the emotional power of avague allegory and its jaring effect when spelled out explicitely, is born out by the following experiment. The words Happy and Angry were presented subliminally to a subject and were followed by the full presentation of an expressionless face. The words tended to produce a corresponding expression in the face, but they became less effective when presented in full awareness. Thus the meaning of a subliminally seen word appears to be assimilated to the face shown after it, while, when consciously observed, it is experienced separately, without affecting the face.

    "content_text": "J \nLecture 2 \nThe Structure of Tacit Knowing. \nby i'lichael Polanyi \n(Delivered at Wesleyan University, October 14, 1965) \nIn my last talk I alluded to the powers of the mind by \nwhich we establish coherence in nature: \na cbherence which reveals \nthe presence of something real in nature. \nI said that coherence \nis often automatically recognised by our eyes and ears, but that \nsuch deeply hidden coherence as natural science seeks to discover, \nis grasped only by a creative act of the imagination. \nI have said \nthat there is no strict rule by which to distinguish a true coherence \nthat has an important meaning, from an accidental coherence that \nmeans nothing. \nTonight I want to tell you of these mental powers, which \noperating without strict rules, enable us to pursue scientific \nenquiries and to establish their result to be true. \nI shall speak \nof these faculties in broad terms tonight, in the hope of explaining \nin a week's time in greater detail how they actually carry out the \ntask of scientific discovery. \n* \nWhen I point my finger at the wall and call out: \n'Look \nat this!' all eyes turn to the wall, away from my finger. \nYou are \nclearly attending to my pointing finger, but only in order to look \nat something else, namely at the point to which my finger is directing \nyour attention. \nWe have here two different ways of being aware of \nthings. \nOne way is to look at a thing. \nThis is the way you look \nat the wall. \nBut how is one to describe the way you see my finger \npointing at the wall? You are not looking at my finger, but away \nfrom it. \nI should say that you do not see it as a mere object, to \nbe examined as such, but as an object having a function, the function \nof directing your attention away from itself and at something else. \nBut this is not to say that my pointing finger was trying to make \nyou disregard itself. \nFar from it. It wanted to be seen, but to \nbe seen only in order to be followed and not in order to be examined. \nI shall call my pointing finger a subsidiary thing or an \ninstrumental thing that functions by pointing at an object which is \nat the focus of our attention. \nAnd I suggest that we have here two \ndifferent kinds of awareness. \nWe are subsidiarily aware of the \npointing finger and focally aware of the object that it points at. \nWe establish an integrated relationship between them by recognising \nthe direction in which the finger directs us and by following this \ndirection, \nThis relationship is not symmetrical. \nThe finger points \nat the wall, but the wall does not point at the finger. \nThe rela-\ntionship that we have established has an intrinsic direction, it is \ndirective. \nThus the finger has a meaning that the wall lacks. \nIt \ncan raise a problem; \nif you come across a pointing finger by itself \nin a wood, it makes you wonder what it may be pointing at. \nThis \nshows that it is for us to establish the coherence of the pointing \nfinger with that which it points at. It is for us to comprehend \nthe coherent system connecting a subsidiary element with the focal \npoint on which the subsidiary element bears. \nAnd note that we \nperform this comprehending without a word. \nNo syllogism is set up, \nno evidence is cited. \nThe performance is tacit, and since its \nresult is valid, we may call it an act of tacit inference. \nAnother case of this kind - to be found at the bottom \nof the table - will reinforce this analysis and develop\u00a2 it further. \nThink of a pair of stereoscopic photographs, viewed in the proper \nway, one eye looking at one, the other eye at the other. \nThe \nobjects shown in the two pictures appear in their joint image as \ndistributed in depth, hard and tangible. \nThis is what we see at \nthe focus of our eyes, but it involves also the sight of the two \ncomponent pictures: \ncover these up and we see nothing at all. \nBut we do not see these two pictures in themselves. \nIn a way we \nlook through them or from them to their joint image. \nSo I shall \nclass our awareness of them as subsidiary and observe that the way \nwe look at them integrates their sights into the spacially deepened \nimage to which they contribute. \nThanks to our integration the two \nflat pictures effectively function as clues to a spacial image. \nWe may say that this image is their joint meaning and that \nthis joint meaning lies in the focus of our attention. \nSo far the \nstructure of this tacit integration is analogous to that of a finger \npointing at an object. \nBut something important is added here. \nThe \njoint meaning of the subsidiaries is expressed in a new sensory \nquality. Sights in depth have come about by integrating sights \nthat were comparatively flat. \nThis change of appearance is in fact a regular accompani-\nment of tacit integration. \nA pointing finger also looks a little \ndifferent than the finger fixed in the same position by arthritis. \nThis kind of difference is more noticeable in the closely analogous \ncase of a word denoting an object. \nThe word when functioning in \nthis way appears transparent, by contrast to its opaque appearance, \nwhen we listen to it as a sequence of sounds. \nI shall come back to \n\n4 -\nthis later. \nThe functions of the subsidiaries, which brings out \ntheir joint meaning,will be seen usually expressed in a novel \nappearance. \nProfessor Hadley Cantril of Princeton has shown that when \nwe introduce two fairly disparate pictures into the stereoscope, we \nsee fanciful integrations of them. \nSuch images are illusory. \nBut \nwe may limit ourselves to the case that the two pictures viewed \nare proper photographs and th~t hence their stereoscoping image \nis a reasonably correct evaluation of their joint meaning, \nWe can \nthen regard stereoscopic viewing as a feat of tacit inference in \nanalogy to a process of explicit inference. \nBut let me stop to warn here from a misconception. \nIt is \na mistake to identify subsidiary awareness with sub-conscious or \npre-conscious awareness, or with the fringe of consciousness des-\n,cribed by William James. \nThe relation of subsidiaries to that on \n/\nwhich they bear is a logical relation similar to that which a premiss \nhas to the inference drawn from it, with the great difference, that \nthe inferences arrived at here are tacit, Subsidiary awareness can \nbe fully conscious, as that of a pointing finger or a pair of pictures \nviewed in the stereoscope, though in other cases our consciousness \nof subsidiaries may be on a very low level and may be altogether \nsubliminal. \nAs we touch upon the several examples in the table we \nshall meet with every level of consciousness among the subsidiaries. \nThese variations in their level of consciousness in no way affect \ntheir functions as subsidiary elements of an act of tacit knowing. \nJean Piaget has strikingly contrasted the act of acquiring \nknowledge by a sensory act like perception as compared with a process \nof explicit inference. \nHe points out that explicit inference, is \nTable to page 4: \nTacit Knowing: \nFrom subsidiaries \nby integrating them \nwe focus at \nfinger \npointing at \nan object \nname \ndesignating \na person \nfeatures \nforming \na physiognomy \nmotions \ncombined to \nskilled action \nprobe \nexploring \na cavity \nsensory clues \ncombined to \na percept \nfactual clues \nleading to \na discovery \nstereo pictures \nviewed as \na stereo image \nreve_\u00a3sible in the sense that we can go back to its premisses and \ngo forward again to its conclusions, as often ffS we like, while this \nis not tr>ue for the sensory act. \nAnd since perception is always \ncombined with action and action with sensation, Piaget contrasts all \nsensorimotor acts with explicit inferences and calls them irreversible \nAll acts of tacit integration are irreversible, and this can be \nunderstood from the structure of tacit knowing. \nWe find indeed that \ntacit knowing can have two kinds of irreversibility. \nOne consists \nin the fact that we may not be able to identify all the clues which \nwe have integrated in establishing their joint meaning. \nThe other \nkind of irreversibility goes beyond this. \nIt is due to the fact \nthat when wi shift the focus of our attention from the meaningful \nresult of tacit integration, and focus on the subsidiaries, their \nintegration is wiped out. \nThe subsidiary particulars cease to have \na bearing on their prospective target and are reduced to an aggregate \nof meaningless objects. \nThe first kind of irreversibility can be \n~ \ncontingent, by contrast to the second, that is logically necessary. \nThe joint viewing of two stereoscopic photographs offers \na simple example both of contingent and logical irreversibility. \n,, \nThink of the differences in the two pictures, by virtue of which \ntheir joint viewing offers the sight of spacial depth: \nthese dif-\nferences are very small and are scattered all over the pictures. \nIt is almost impossible to identify them, they are virtually un-\nspecifiable. \nThis is the first kind of irreversibility. \nBut even \nif we could overcome this and identify the clues of stereoscopic \nvision it would not be the same as retracing the steps of a mathe-\nmatical proof. \nTo reconsider a mathematical deduction, is to deepen \nour understanding of the idea which it embodies. \nWe can see now in \nthe premises the whole panorama of their implications. \nBy contrast, \nif we take out the stereo pictures from the viewer and look at them \nseparately, the cease to tell us anything of what they jointly mean, \nwe see nothing of what they would jointly present to our eyes. \nTo \ngo back to the antecedents of our tacit inference, has not deepened \nour grasp of its result, but has made us lose sight of it. You can \nverify this in all the instances of tacit knowing listed in the \ntable. \nI have mentioned already in passing the most widely known \nexample of this disintegration of meaning, caused by the shifting \nof our focal attention to that which has this meaning. \nA spoken \nword loses its meaning if we repeat it a number of times, while \ncarefully attending to the movement of our lips and tongue and to \nthe sound we are making. \nThese actions were meaningful, so long \nas we attended to that on which they jointly bear and lost their \nmeaning when we shifted our attention to them. \nIt is also well known \nthat we tend to lose control of the motions forming a skilful \nperformance, if we attend to them closely. \nThe famous tight-rope \nwalker, Blondin, says in his memoirs that he would instantly lose \nhis balance if he thought directly of keeping it; \nhe must force \nhimself to think only of the way he would eventually descend from \nthe rope. \nAdmittedly, the disintegration of tacit knowledge by \nshifting our attention to its clues is not irreparable. \nThe two \nstereo pictures can be viewed once more jointly; \nthe word that lost \nits meaning will regain it if we once more use it, once more subsi-\ndiarly be casting our mind forward to something we can say by it. \nThe paralysis of a skill, due to switching our attention to the \nmotions that compose its performance, can be remedied by attendi~g \nonce more to the purpose which our co-ordinated motions are to serve. \nBut it is important to note that this recovery never brings \nback the original meaning. \nIt may improve on it. Motion studies, \nwhich tend to paralyse a skill, will improve it when followed by \npractice. \nThe meticulous dismembering of a text which can kill its \nappreciation can also supply material for a much deeper understanding \nof it. In these cases, the detailing of particulars, which, by \nitself, would destroy meaning, serves as a guide to their subsequent \nintegration and thus establishes a more secure and more accurate \nmeaning of them. \nBut the damage done by the specification of particulars \nmay be irremediable. \nMeticulous detailing may obscure beyond recall \na subject like history, literature or philosophy. \nIn his essay on \nthe Name and Nature of Poetry A. E. Housman has described the dis-\nastrous effect of spelling out in detail the allusions of Edgar Poe \n1, \nin his poem The Haunted Palace. \nMy former colleague at Manchester \nthe distinguished French scholar Mansell Jones has written that the \nhumanities are discredited and rejected because of their unconscious \nabuse of eructation in the teaching of humane subjects. \n\"Research -\nhe wrote - is at once the flower and the virus of Arts.\" \nBut it is not the unintentional damage done to our tacit \nknowledge, by reducing our capacity to re-integrate its subsidiaries \nafter having brought them to the light of focal consciousness, that \nis the main issue here; it is a deliberate refusal to rely on the \ntacit mode of integration. \nThe modern mind refuses to accept the \nnecessity for tacit assumptions and wants to keep the grounds of its \nbeliefs clearly in focus, as one does in an explicit deduction. \nOur \nwhole culture is pervaded by the resolve to avoid unspecifiable \ncommitments and to get down ruthlessly to the hard facts of this \nworld and to keep our eyes firmly fixed on them. \nThis is true above all for science. It was science that \noriginated this spirit of ruthless enquiry and in the twentieth \ncentury science itself was subjected to this enquiry, demanding \nstrict methods of research and, above all, strict criteria of meaning \nand truth in science. \nScience shall remain my main example for the \n* \"The Haunted Palace is one of Poe's best poems so long as we are \ncontent to swim in the sensations it evokes and only vaguely to \napprehend the allegory. \nWe are roused to discomfort, at least I am, \nwhen we begin to perceive how exact in detail the allegory is; when \nit dawns upon us that the fai.r palace door is Roderick Usher's mouth, \nthe pearl and ruby his teeth and lips, the yellow banners his hair, \nthe ramparts plumed and pallid his forehead, and when we are reduced \nto hoping, for i.t is no more than a hope, that the winged odours \nhave no connexion with hair-oil.\" A.

Let us look into this. \nIt is a fact that we can know a person's face and recognise \nhim among a thousand, indeed among a million, yet usually cannot \ntell how we recognise a face we know. \nAnd we have many other in-\nstances of the recognition of a characteristic appearance in science \nitself, which have the same structure as the identification of a \nperson. \nAt the universities great efforts are spent in practical \nclasses to teach students to identify cases of diseases and specimens \nof rocks, plants and animals. \nAll descriptive sciences study such \nphysiognomies which cannot be fully described in words, nor even by \npictures. \nAll this practical teaching must rely on the intelligent \npupil's capacity to recognise the relevant particulars of a physiog-\nnomy and their characteristic relationship in the physiognomy. It \nrelies also on it that he acquires a skill in testing, which entails \na combination of motions which will remain unspecifiable. \nBut can it not be argued that the possibility of teaching \nthe recognition of characteristic appearances proves that we can \ntell what we know of them? \nNo, what the pupil must discover for \nhimself by trial and error is - even though he be guided by our \nadvice and example - something we could not tell him. \nThe way this happens will become clearer from some fairly \nrecent work in experimental psychology, which has developed a method \nfor studying the elementary act on which all tacit knowing is based. \nI am referring to the phenomenon called subception, which was first \ndefinitely observed and named subception by Lazarus and McCleary in \n+949, \nThey presented a subject a large number of nonsense syllables, \nand after showing him certain of the syllables, they administered \nan electric shock to him. \nPresently the subject showed symptoms \nof anticipating the shock at the sight of \"shock syllables\"; yet, \non questioning, he could not identify them. \nHe had come to know \nwhen to expect a shock, but he could not tell what made him expect \nit. \nHe had acquired a knowledge similar to that which we have when \nwe know a person by signs which we cannot tell. \nAnother variant of this phenomenon was demonstrated by \nErikson and Kuethe in 1956. \nThey exposed a person to shock whenever \nhe happened to utter associations to certain 'shock words'. \nSoon \nthe person learned to forestall the shock by avoiding the utterance \nof such associations but, on questioning, it appeared that he did \nnot know he was doing this. \nHere the subject invented a practical \noperation, but could not tell how he worked it. \nThis kind of sub-\nception has the structure of a skill, for a skill combines elementary \nmuscular acts which are not identifiable. \nThe analysis of subception wards off the suspicion of \nself-contradiction, which may arise in other cases when anyone speaks \nof things he himself both knows and cannot tell. Subception divides \nthese two functions, so that one person observes that another person \nhas a knowledge that he cannot tell. \nNo one speaks then of a \nknowledge that he himself has and cannot tell. \nWe can sum up so far as follows. \nIn two experiments, \nsubception was induced by electric shock. \nIn the first series, the \nsubject was shocked after being presented with certain nonsense \nsyllables, and he learnt to expect the shock. \nIn the second series \nhe learnt to suppress the uttering of certain associations which \nwould evoke the shock. \nIn both cases the knowledge of the shock-\nproducing particulars remained unidentifiable, yet the subject \nrelied on his awareness of them for anticipating the shock. \nHe had \nacquired a subsidiary awareness of these particulars while attending \nfocally to the expectation of a shock; \nthe particulars had become \nthe subsidiary term of a tacit knowledge of which the expectation \nof the shock was the focal term. \nThe conclusions of Lazarus and icfoCleary have been contested \nbut eventually confirmed by its very critic. Many further experimenti:: \nhave lent support to the effectiveness of this kind of subception. \nMoreover, a new variant of subception, described by \nHefferline in 1959, extended experimental tacit knowing to subliminal \nstimuli: Hefferline observed that when spontaneous muscular twitches, \nunfelt by the subject - but observable by a million-fold amplificatioi, \nof their action currents - were followed by the brief cessation of \nan unpleasant noise, the subject responded by increasing the frequency \nof the twitches and thus silencing the noise more frequently. \n\nI \nExperiments carried out during the past decade in Soviet Russia \nhave shown this phenomenon in a different manner (Razran 1961). \nWhen an internal stimulus which the subject cannot notice in itself -\nsuch as the injection of a stream of acidified water in the intesti-\nnal canal - is repeatedly followed by a punishment, the internal \nstimulus will come to arouse an expectation of the punishment. \nMore recently, Hefferline produced a new variant of his \nexperiments on subliminal twitches. \nHe succeeded in training sub-\njects to press a lever every time a spontaneous twitch occurred in \ntheir selected muscle, \nThey had of course no idea what it was they \nwere responding to. \nIt is to thj_s type of. experiments I was referring, when \nI said at the beginning, that the subsidiary elements of tacit \nknowing can be on any level of consciousness, from a fully conscious \nlevel, down to one far below our powers of apprehension. \nRemember also that the focal experience arrived at by \ntacit inference, tells us the meaning of the subsidiaries in terms \nof a sensation that was not present before. \nA subliminal event \nintegrated to a focal act or to a focal stimulus produces a maximum \ndegree of phenomenal change. \nThings that cannot be experienced in \nthemselves at all.act as instruments of conscious performances or \nelse they stimulate conscious actions without being noticed in \nthemselves. \nThere is another point to take up on this occasion. \nRight \nat the start, when I pointed at the wall and you looked at j_ t, you \nintegrated the sight of my pointing finger to that which I was \npointing at. It is difficult to say where the focal experience, \nnamely the wall with the finger pointing at it, was eventually \nsituated, \nThe stereoscopic viewing of two photographs produced a \njoint picture of them which was certainly not at the place where \nthe pictures were. \nIn other cases, as in the integration of muscular \nmotions to the performance of a skill, or the integration of features \nto a physiognomy, the result may be thought to lie about at the same \nplace where the subsidiaries are situated, \nThe Hefferline type of \nexperiments produce integrated events not easily localisable, but \ncertainly not located at the place inside the body where the sub-\nsidiaries are happening. \nBut there can occur a more definite displac~ment of feelings \nfrom where the subsidiaries are first noticed, a displacement which \ncorresponds to a meaningful integration of them. \nWe find this in \nthe way we learn to use a probe for exploring a cavity, or in the \nway a blind man feels his way by tapping around with a stick. \nWhen \nusing a probe for the first time we feel its impact against our \nfingers and palm. \nBut as we learn to use a probe, or to use a stick \nfor feeling our way, our awareness of its impact on our hand is \ntransformed into a sense of its point touching the objects we are \nexploring. \nThus our integrative effort transposes our meaninglcs~ \nfeelings in:tQ__meaningful ones, and places these at some distance \nfrom the original feelings. \nWe become aware of the feelings in our \nhand in terms of their meaning located at the far end of the probe \nor stick, to which we are attending. \nThis happens also when we \nlearn to use a tool. \nWe attend to the meaning of its impact on our \nhands in terms of its effects on the things to which we are applying \nit and thus make these effects increasingly mea.ningful. \nIt should be clear by now how profoundly the act of tacit \nintegra.tion differs from a process of explicit deduction. \nTo go back \nto the grounds on which a tacit integration rests, we have not only \nto contend with its logical irreversibility which blots out the \nsight of the integrated conclusions the moment we direct our atten-\ntion to its premises, but - as we have seen - many of these pre-\nmises may not only be dj_fficult to identify, but be actually not \nobservable in themselves at all. \nWe are far away from the precisely \ndefined and publicly visible evidende required by the ideal of the \nexact sciences, and indeed from any acknowledged standards of em-\npirical evidence, \nMoreover when we watch how tacit knowing operates \non its antecedents, the difference from explicit in_:f'EJ_rence becomes \neven more marked. \nThe clues are subjected to an integration which \ncan be carried out only by a private mental act, \nIt is only through \nour own eyes that the sight of two stereo pictures can be trans-\nformed into the spacial sight of their content. \nNo manipulation \nof symbols can perform this act, its quality must be seen to be known, \nFor an integration that yields a meaning links together two kinds of \nawareness, the subsidiary and the focal, while by contrast, symbols \nused in an explicit inference can all be put down on a blackboard \nand be seen there focally by the same kind of awareness. \nMeaning \nmust therefore be experienced as a sensory quality. \nFinally, the meaning we arrive at may be something as \nunsubstantial as the stereoscopic image, or an undefinable human \nphysiognomy, in which we recognise the emotional, intellectual and \nmoral capabilities of a human mind, \n* \nWe are now ready to take up our central purpose, which \nis to discern the ,powers by which we recognise coherence in nature, \nI have to describe now the act of perception more completely. \nFor \nmany years I have pursued the idea that the principles of scientific \nknowledge and discovery are to be found in the mechanism of per-\nception, so I have to describe now the act of perception in the terms \nof tacit knowing and then generalise the result to the process of \nscientific discovery. \nSuppose I look at my right hand. \nI recognise its area \nby its closed contours, but if that were all, my hand, when moved \nabout, would keep changing its colour, its shape and its size. \nThe experience of my hand as a solid object, having definite pro-\nperties, would never asrise. \nI see it as such, by integration of \na host of rapidly changing clues, both in the field of vision and \ninside my eyes and some still deeper in my body, \nMy powers of \nrecognising coherence makea me see these thousand changing clues \njointly, as one single unchanging object moving about at different \ndistances, viewed from different angles, under variable illuminations. \nA successful integration of innumerable rapidly changing particulars \ninto a single constant sight, makes us recognise that we have a real \nobject before us. \nIt is interesting to note here the stages between things \npatently real to other things of a more or less dubious reality. \nLook at a finger of your hand through a pinhole in a sheet of paper, \nor better still, through a blackened tube, and then move your finger \nback and forth. \nYou will see it swelling as it approaches your eye \nand shrinking again when moved away. \nPsychologists have called this \neffect a \"de-realisation.\" The moving object has lost its constant \nsize, for some important clues to its constancy coming from the \ncorner of our eyes have been cut off by the blackened tube. \nWe can \nsay that its coherence having been impoverished, the object's reality \nhas become dubious. \nTaking this little experiment into account, we can note \nthat the integration carried out by our eyes in looking at something, \ncomprises clues at three levels of consciousness. \nThere are the \nthings straight in front of us, seen quite consciously then there \nare many things seen at the edge of the visual field, which we take \nin without hardly noticing them, and thirdly there are a great many \ninternal clues, like the contraction of our eye muscles or the \nchanging situation in the cavity of the internal ear, Which we cannot \nfeel in themselves at all, \nAll these experiences function jointly \nin seeing an object. \nThe way I see my hand moving about in front of \nme, the distance at which I see it, the shape I see it having, its \ncolour and texture, the speed and direction of its motion, all its \nsensory qualities, are determined by clues--whether manifest or \nmarginal, or deeply hidden and subliminal--which are integrated into \nits appearance. \nThe appearance of the object, persistent and real, \nis the joint meaning of all these subsidiaries. \nBefore passing on from here to the case of scientific \nknowledge and scientific discovery, I want to mention one more \ncharacteristic of tacit_integration to which Conrad Lorenz has called \nattention. It is speed of such integration. \nWould we have to note \none by one the subsidiary elements for seeing our hand in motion \nand have to combine them by some explicit operation, most of them \nwould be long since gone before we got round to them. \nThe lightening \nspeed of tacit integration is due to the simple fact that tacit \nintegration handles its clues simultaneously. \nWe can see this at \nwork in the simultaneous coordination of dozens of muscles for the \nperformance of a skill - which is of course an instance of tacit \nintegration. \nAll these features can be recognised in the process of \nscientific discovery. \nBut I shall speak of this only briefly, \nbecause it will be fully treated next week. \nLet me use a quotation \nfrom a text by the English philosopher William Whewell written more \nthan a century ago. \nIn his works I have been happy to find striking \nanticipations of my own view of science. \nSpeaking of Kepler's \ndiscovery of the elliptic path of the planet Mars, Whewell wrote: \n\"To hit upon the right conception is a difficult \nstep; and when this step is once made, the facts \nassume a different aspect from what they had \nbefore: that done, they are seen in a new point \nof view; \nand the catching this pbint of view, is \na special mental operation, requiring special \nendowments and habits of thought. \nBefbre this, \nthe facts are seen as detached, separate, lawless; \nafterwards, they are seen as connected, simple, \nregular; \nas parts of one general fact, and thereby \npossessing innumerable new relations before unseen.\" \nThere is no question here of a systematic induction, obser\u2022ring that \nall A-s are B-s checked by the principles of Agreement and Difference \npropounded by J. S. Mill at that time and still widely acknowledged \nto-day. \nWhewell scathingly attacked tTill a few paragraphs further \nin the same book. \nHe is very conscious of his own distinctive posi-\ntion by speaking of discovery as the difficult step of hitting on \nthe right conception of things. \nHe sees it as the catching of a new \npoint of view, in the light of which the facts take on a different \nappearance. \nThey had previously appeared unrelated, lawless and \nnow they are seen as connected and regular, as parts of a comprehen-\nsive fact. \nThis is tacit integration as I have described it. \nAnd \nto this Whewell makes a most striking addition. \nHe says that by \nbecoming parts of a comprehensive entity the facts acquire innumerable \nnew relations before unseen. \nI think he speaks here of the unex-\nhaustible implications I have ascribed to the discovery of a true \ncoherence in nature, the inexhaustible implications arising from \nthe discovery's bearing on reality, \n* \nI have spoken of perception as an instance of tacit knowing \nand this amounts to a theory of perception. It says that when light \nfrom an object falls into our eyes and our body responds to this in \na number of ways, we are aware of these events in terms of seeing \nthe object. \nWe are aware of these internal happenings in terms of \nthe position, size, shape and motion of the object, these sights \nbeing the joint meaning of these.internal events, \nThis, I said, \ngoes on according to the principles of tacit_ :integration, that I \nhave illustrated for a number of other instances given in my table. \nSubsidiaries are brought into operation by virtue of our integrative \npowers which produce,, their joint meaning, a meaning expressed by \nan appearance not present in the subsidiaries before, \nI know that this sounds like the somewhat vague theory of \nprojection, which has been effectively opposed by pointing out that \nwe are not previously aware internally of the sense impressions \nwhich we are supposed to project outside. \nBut tacit integration \ndoes change the appearance of the subsidiaries in bringing out their \njoint meaning: \nMoreover, we have seen experiments by Hefferline \nand others in which internal events of which we cannot sense in \nthemselves at all can be integrated to the performance of external \naction. \nThe transposition of feelings in our palm to the far end \nof a probe when used in exploring a cavity, lends further support \nto the occurrence of projection as a result of tacit integration. \nProjection of subsidiary experience to a distante place where it \nmakes sense is clearly established in these cases and authorises in \nmy view my analogous assumption for the interpretation of perception, \nI would venture, therefore, to extend the scope of tacit \nknowing to include the neural traces in the cortex of the nervous \nsystem. \nThis would place events going on inside our brain on the \nsame footing as the subliminal twitches in Hefferline 1s experiments. \nThe relation of mind and body becomes then an instance of the rela-\ntion between the two terms of tacit knowing, the subsidiary and the \nfocal, \nSuch a hypothesis does not explain how perceived sights, \nor any other states of consciousness, arise in conjunction with \nneural processes. \nIt merely applies the principle that wherever \nsome process in our body gives rise to consciousness in us, our \ntacit knowing of the process will make sense of it in terms of an \nexperience to which we are attending. \nThis conception of the way the body participates in the \nact of perception can be generalised to include the bodily roots \nof all knowledge and thought. \nIt throws light then on the peculiar \nknowledge we have of our body by living in it, It makes us aware \nof the fact that our body is the only collection of things which \nwe know almost exclusively by relying on our awareness of them for \nattending to something else. \nOur body serves as a tool for ob-\nserving objects outside us and for manipulating these for purposes \nof our own. \nEvery time we make sense of the world we rely on our \ntacit knowledge of impacts that the world makes on our body and of \nthe response of our body to these impacts. \nSuch is the exceptional \n\u00a3Osition of our body in the universe. \nI have described how we learn to feel the end of a probe \nhitting things outside. \nWe may regard this as the transformation \nof the probe into a sentient extension of our body. \nBut our \nawareness of our body for attending to things outside it suggests \na wider generalisation of the feeling we have of our body. \nWhenever \nwe are using certain things subsidiarily for attending from them to \nother things (in the way we usually use our own body) these things \nchange their appearance. \nThey appear to us now in terms of that \nfrom which we are attending to them, in the same way as we feel our \nown body in terms of things outside to which we are attending from \nour body. \nIn this sense we can say that when we make some things \nfunction as the subsidiary term of tacit knowing, we incorporate \nthese things in our body - or extend our body to include them. \nLet me show you at a glance the wide consequences of this \nconclusion. \nWe make a thing function as the subsidiary term of a \ncomprehensive entity whenever we see it as part of a whole. \nWe have \nanalysed many instances of this kind: \nthe seeing of a solid body, \nKepler's discovery of eliptical orbits, the identification of \nphysiognomies, the practice of skills. \nWe could apply our present \nconclusions to all these, but I want to throw a quick glance over \nwider fields. \nBiology studies the shapes of living things and the \nway they grow into these shapes from germ cells; it describes the \norgans of living things and explains the way they function; it \nexplores the motor and sensory functions of animals and their \nintelligent performances. \nAll these are comprehensive entities. \nMorphology, physiology, animal psychology - they all deal with \n-comprehensive entities. \nThe only way to know them is to comprehend \nthe coherence of their parts. \nThe structure of tacit knowing re-\nquires that we make these parts function as subsidiary terms, in \nthe way we make our body function for handling things outside. It \nrequires that, in this sense, we interiorise these things in order \nto attend f:i:2!!1 them to the comprehensive entiry which they form. \nWe must dwell in them, and not observe them in themselves if we are \nto be aware of their bearing on the entities to which they belong. \nOnly thus can we understand the way these comprehensive entities \nrely on their parts for performing their functions. \nThis adds another important feature to the structure of \ntacit knowing. \nI look forward to showing you as I go on in these \nlectures that tacit knowing is ih fact the sovereign instrument for \nestablishing the existence of comprehensive entities and understanding \ntheir structure and operations. \nNote: E. A. Hausmann's distinction between the emotional power of \navague allegory and its jaring effect when spelled out explicitely, \nis born out by the following experiment. \nThe words Happy and Angry \nwere presented subliminally to a subject and were followed by the \nfull presentation of an expressionless face. \nThe words tended to \nproduce a corresponding expression in the face, but they became less \neffective when presented in full awareness. \nThus the meaning of a \nsubliminally seen word appears to be assimilated to the face shown \nafter it, while, when consciously observed, it is experienced \nseparately, without affecting the face. \nSee Gudmund J.

Lecture 3 The Creative Ima~ination by Michael Polanyi (Delivered at Wesleyan University, October :n, 1965) My lecture, last week, dealt with some curious facts. It showed a number of instances in which we integrate experiences to something on which they bear. We are aware then of such subsidiaries be they clues, or parts, or pointers, or names, or tools, or probes, or motions, in terms of that to which they are directihg our attention, We are aware for example of perceptual clues only in the appearance of things we are looking at. It is amazing at what speed such clues are integrated without being identifiable. Such is the way subsidiaries are brought into action by our powers of tacit integration, and such is, I believe also, the way we discover coherence and reality in nature. This is the idea I want to develop today. If natural science is - as I assume it to be - a generalised form of perception, we might find the prototype of scientific dis- covery in the way we solve a difficult perceptual problem. Take the way we learn to find our way about while wearing inverting spectacles. When you put on spectacles that show things upside down, you feel completely lost and remain helpless for days on end. But if you persist in groping around for a week or more, you find your way again and eventually can even drive a car or climb rocks with the spectacles on. This fact, well known today, was discovered - in essence - by Stratton seventy\u00b7years ago. It is usually said to show that after a time the visual image switches round to the way we normally see it. ifost of the literature says so. But more recent observation has proved that this interpretation is false. It happened, for example, that a person perfectly trained to get around with upside down spectacles, was shown a row of houses at a distance, and was asked whether he saw the houses right way up or upside down. The question puzzled the subject and he replied, after a moment, that he had not thought about the matter before, but that now that he is asked about it he finds that he sees the houses * upside down. Such a reply shows that the visual image of the houses has not turned back to normal; it has remained inverted, but the in- verted image no longer means to the subject that the houses themselvee are upside down. ( &quot; (., , \u00b7r C -1 The invert~d image has been reconnected rationally to other sensory clues, to touch and sound, and weight. These all hang together with the image once more in a way that though the image remains inverted we can again find our way by it safely. A new wav of seeing things rightly has been produced, a new sensory mode estab- lished. And since the m~3:i!ng of the upside down image has now o~~ed, the term &#x27;upside down&#x27; has lost its previous meaning, and it has become confusing to enquire whether something is seen upside down or right way up. The new kind of right seeing can be talked about only in terms of a new vocabulary. I was told that in the Psychology Department at Innsbruck University where these results \u2022~ See F. W. Snyder and N. H. Pronko, Vision with Spatj.al Inversion, Wichita, Kansas (1952). For fuller evidence and its interpretation in the sense given here, see Heinrich Kottenhoff, Was ist r.ichtige~ Sehen mit lhnkehrbrillen und in welchem Sinne stellt sich das Sehen ~? Psychologia Universalis, Vol. 5 (1961). were first clearly developed by Heinrich Kottenhoff (around 1960), they avoid confusion by applying the German words for right and left for the ordinary seeing of things, but use the English words &#x27;right&#x27; and &#x27;left&#x27; when seeing things rightly through right-left inverting spectacles. We may say that the wearer of inverting spectacles re-orga- nises scrambled clues into a new kind of coherence. He again sees objects then, instead of meaningless impressions. He again sees real things, which he can pick up and handle, which have weights pulling in the right direction and make sounds that come from the &lt; place at which he sees them. He has made a novel sense out of chaos. In science, I find the closes~~_p_a!&#x27;allel to this perceptual achievement in the discovery of relativity. Einstein has told the story how from the age of 16 he was obsessed by the following type of speculation. Experiments with falling bodies were known to give the same result on board a ship in motion as they do on solid ground. But what would happen to the light which a lamp would emit on board a moving ship? Supposing the ship moved fast enough, would it over- take the beams of its own light, as a bullet overtakes its own sound by crossing the sonic barrier? Einstein thought that this was in- conceivable, and persisting in this assumption, he eventually suc- ceeded in renewing the conceptions of space and time in a way which would make it inconceivable for the ship to overtake, however slightly, its own light rays. After this, questions about a definite span of time or space became meaningless and confusing - exactly as questions of &quot;above&quot; and 91below&quot; became 11LGAningless and con.fusing to a subject * who had adapted his vision to inverting spectacles. It is no accident that it is the most radical innovation in the history of science that appears most similar to the way we acquire the capacity for seeing inverted images rightly. For only a comprehensive problem, like relativity, can require that we reorga- nise such basic conceptions as we do in learning to see rightly through inverting spectacles. Relativity alone involves conceptual innovations as strange and paradoxical as those we make in reorgani- sing an inverted vision. The experimental verificationsof relativity have shown that the coherence discerned by Einstein was real. One of these confirmations has a curious history. Einstein had assumed that a 04t light source would never overtake a beam sent/by it, a fact that has already been established before by Michelson and Morley. In his autobiography Einstein says that he made this assumption intui- tively from the start, which is to say that he recognised it by an act of tacit knowing. But this account failed to convince his con- temporaries, for intuition was not regarded as a legitimate ground for knowledge. Text books of physics described, therefore, Einstein&#x27;s theory as his answer to the experiments of Michelson. When I tried to put the record right, by accepting Einstein&#x27;s claim that he had intuitively - that is tacitly - recognised the facts already demon- strated by Michelson, I was attacked and ridiculed by Professor GrUnbaum of Pittsburgh, who argued that Einstein must have known of Michelson&#x27;s experiment, since he could not otherwise have based * References to Einstein&#x27;s autobiography are based on Albert Einstein, &quot;Biographical Notes&quot; in Albert Einstein, Philosopher-Scientist, ed. P.A. Schilpp, New York, (I949) p. 53, * himself on the facts established by these experiments. But if science is a generalised form of perception, Einstein&#x27;s story of his intuition is clear enough. He had started from the principle that it is impossible to observe absolute motion in mechanics, and when he came across the question whether this prin- ciple holds also when light is emitted, he felt that it must still hold, but he could not quite tell why he assumed this. This is exactly how unaccountable assumptions are made in the way we perceive things and these assumptions cah affect also the way scientists see them. Newton&#x27;s assumption of absolute rest 1 the assumption which Einstein was to refute, owed its convincing power to the way we commonly see things. We see a car travelling along a road and never the road sliding away under the car. We see the road at absolute rest. We generally see things as we do, for this establishes co- herence within the context of our experience. So when Einstein ex- tended his vision to the universe and included the case of a light source emitting a beam, he could make sense of this only by seeing it in such a way that the beam was never overtaken, however slightly, by its source. This is what he meant by saying that he knew intuiti- vely that this was in fact so. We can understand now also why the grounds on which Coperni- cus claimed that his system was real could be convincing to him, though 1 not convincing to others. We have seen that the tacit powers that / are at work in perception integrate clues which, being subsidiarily known, are largely unspecifiable; we have seen further that the intuition by which Einstein shaped his novel conceptions of time and space was also based on clues which were largely unspecifiable; we * Adolf GrUnbaum, Philosophical Problems of Space and Time, New York (1963), pp. 378-85. may assume then that this was true also for Cpernicus shaping his vision of reality, And we may sum up by saying. Science is based on.clu~ -~ that have a bearing on reality. These clues are not fully specifia- ble; nor is the process of integration \\4hich connects them fully definable; while the future manifestations of the reality indicated by this coherence are inexhaustible, These three indeterminacies defeat any attempt at a strict theory of scientific validity and prove indispensahle the powers of tacit knowing. * This gives us a general idea of the way scientific know- ledge is established at the end of an enquiry; it tells us how we judge that our result is coherent and real, But it does not show clearly how we start an enquiry; nor how we know, once we have started, which way to turn for a solution. At the beginning of a quest we can know only vaguely what we may hope to discover; it may seem strange, therefore, how we can ever start off and go on with an enquiry without lc11owing what exactly we are looking for, This question goes back to antiquity. Plato set it in the Meno. He said, in effect, that if we know the solution of a problem, there is no problem - and if we don&#x27;t know the solution, we do not know what we are looking for and cannot expect to find anything. He concluded that when we do solve problems, we do it by remembering past incarnations. This strange solution of the dilemma may have pre~ ,! f : &#x27; , &#x27;- \u00b7V &#x27; \u2022- -1-~~&#x27;, (&#x27; vented it from being taken seriously. Yet the problem is ineluctable and can be answered only by recognising a kind of tacit knowing or intuition, that is more dynamic than the one I have dwellt on so far. I have spoken repeatedly of our powers to perceive a</p>\n<p>I coherence bearing on reality, with its hidden future manifestations, And I have mentioned in my first lecture also a more specific know- ledge of hidden coherence: the kind of foreknowledge we have in a problem. And we know that the scientist&#x27;s imagination sees problems, produces hunches, and, stirred by these anticipations, pursues his quest towards them. We may say that this quest is guided at every stage by feelings of a deepening coherence, of feelings that have a fair chance of proving right. We may recognise in them the working of a dynamic intuition: in other words, the power which achieves tac~t- knowledge. The mechanism of this power can be illuminated by an analogy, Physics speaks of potential energy that is released when a weight slides down a slope. Our search for deeper coherence is guided likewise by a potentiality. We feel the slope towards deeper insight.as we feel the direction in which a heavy weight is pulled along a steep incline. This is the dynamic intuition that guides the pursuit of discovery. That is how I would resolve the paradox of the Meno: we can pursue scientific discovery without knowing what we are looking .,/for, because the gradient of deepening coherence tells us where to start and which way to turn, and eventually brings us to the point where we may stop and claim a discovery. The resemblance to the way the painter or the poet are guided by the hidden coherence they are seeking seems clear. But we must yet acknowledge further powers of intuition without which scientists or inventors could neither rationally choose a particular problem nor pursue any chosen problem successfully. Think of Stratton devising his clumsy inverting spectacles and then groping about guided by the inverted vision of a single narrowly restricted eye for days on end. He must have been firmly convinced that he would learn to find his way about within reasonable time, and also that the result would be worth all the trouble of his strange enterprise - and he proved right. Or think of Einstein, when as a boy he came across the speculative dilemma of a light source pur- suing its own ray. He did not brush the matter aside as a mere oddity, as anybody else would have done. His intuition told him that there must exist a principle which would assure the impossibility of observing absolute motion in any circumstances. Through years of sometimes despairing enquiry, he kept up his conviction that the discovery he was seeking was within his ultimate reach and that it would prove worth the torment of its pursuit; and again, Einstein proved right. Kepler too might have reasonably concluded, after some five years of vain efforts, that he was wasting his time, but he persisted and proved right. The-power by which such long range assessments are made may be called a strategic intuition. It is practised every day on a high level of responsibility in industrial research laboratories. The director of such a laboratory does not usually make inventions, but is responsible for assessing the value of problems suggested to him, be it from outside or by members of his laboratory. For each such problem the director must jointly estimate the chances of its successful pursuit, the value of its possible solution, and also the costs of achieving it. He must compare this combination with the joint assessment of the same characteristics for rival problems. On these grounds he has to decide whether the pursuit of a problem should be undertaken or not, and if undertaken, what grade of priority should be given to it in the use of available resources, The scientist is faced with similar decisions. An intuition that merely points out a number of problems does not tell him which problem to choose. He must be able to estimate the gap separating himJ:rom discovery and he must also be able roughly to assess whether the importance of a possible discovery would warrant the investment of the powers and resources needed for its pursuit. Without this kind of strategic intuition, he would waste his opportunities on wild goose chases and be soon out of a job. The kinds of intuition I have recognised here are the dynamic forms of tacit knowing. Such an intuition is quite different from the supreme immediate knowledge called intuition by Leibniz or Spinoza or Husserl. It is a skill for guessing with a reasonable / chance of guessing right; a skill guided by an innate sensitivity to coherence, improved by schooling. The fact that this faculty often fails does not discredit it; a method for guessing ten percent above average chance on roulette would be worth millions. Of the infallible intuition of idealistic philosophy I know nothing and I doubt that it exists. But to know what to look for does not lend us the power to seek it and find it, I have spoken in my first lecture of the way the anticipatory powers of the scientist&#x27;s imagination sees a problem; I must work out now more generally the part played by the imagination in the dynamics of tacit knowing. All thoughts of things that are not present, or of things not vet present - or perhaps never to be present - all such thoughts I shall call acts of the imagination. When I intent! to lift my arm, this intention is an act of my imagination. In this case imagining is not visual but muscular. An athlete keyed up for a high jump is engaged in an intense act of muscular imagination. But even in the effortless lifting of an arm, we can recognise a conscious iinteption, -- ~--\u00b7- and an act of the imagination, distinct from its muscular execution. For we never decree the muscular performance itself, since we have no direct control over it. This delicately co-ordinated feat of muscular contractions is ordered spontaneously, in response to our imaginative act of volition. This dual structure of deliberate movement was first des- cribed by William James seventy years ago. We see now that it corresponds to the two kinds of awareness that we have met in all tacit knowing. We may say that we have a focal awareness of: lifting our arm, and that this focal act is implemented by the ,integration of subsidiary muscular particulars. We may put it as in the case of perception, that we are focally aware of a deliberate achievement and aware of its particulars only subsidiarily, by attending to that which they jointly constitute. But a new life, a new intensity, enters into this two- levelled structure the moment our intention meets with difficulties. The two levels fall apart then and the imagination sallies forward, seeking to close the gap between them. Take the example of learning to ride a bicycle. Our imagination is fixed on this aim, but our present capabilities being insufficient, our execution of it falls hehind. By straining every nerve to close this gap, we gradually learn to keep our balance on a bicycle. We find that such an effort results in an amazingly sophisticated policy of which we know nothing. Our muscles are set</p>\n<p>- 11 A so as to counteract at every moment our accidental imbalance, by turning the bicycle into a curve with a radius proportional to the square of its velocity, divided by the angle of our imbalance. &#x27; Millions of people are cycling all over the world by skilfully applying this formula which they could not remotely understand if they were told about it, This puzzling fact is explained by the i two-levelled structure of intentional action~ as follows. The use of the formula is invented on the subsidiary level in response to the efforts to close the gap between intention and performance; and since the performance has been produced subsidiarily, it may remain focally unknown. Remember also Hefferline&#x27;s experiments showing how an active intention can evoke covertly, inside our body, the means of its implementation. There is a detail of thE experiment I have not told you about, Spontaneous muscular twitches, imperceptible to the subject, were rewarded by a brief pause in an unpleasant noise; and as soon as this was done, the frequency of the twitches multiplied ! about threefold. And when in some cases the subject was shown on a galvanometer the electrical effect of his twitches, the frequency t,, of the twitches shot up to about six times their normal rate. For years I have been puzzled by this effect, until it dawned upon me that the galvanometer readings support the subject&#x27;s int&#x27;ention, by serving him as a guide to his imagination. I have found this effect confirmed in a number of other experiments by various psychologists. * See R. F. Hefferline et al. Science ITT59) Vol. 130, pp. 1338-9, See also Science (1963) Vol. 139, pp. 834-5 and R. F. Hefferline &quot;Learning Theory and Clinical Psychology&quot; in Expe~imental Foundations of Clinical Psychology, ed. A. J, Bachrach, New York (1962). Recent work in Russia has shown that the sight or sound of a novel intriguing kind evokes a general mobilisation of internal bodily processes. Such internal responses are found in animals right down to fishes. They have been called an orientgtign re.tllex and / . may be taken to signify the excitement of meeting a problem. If the problem is unpleasant and one of the mobilised internal events chances to bring it under control, this event will be repeated more frequently, as Hefferline 1s twitches were, If, on the other hand, the problem turns out to be of no consequence, habituation will set in: the animal will cease to worry, Rabbits show habituation after 6 to 15 presentations of a strange sight, but birds take longer and carps may cease to get excited only after seeing a problematic sight 170 * times. They are an ideal audience for telling it the same joke over and over again. This is the kind of mechanism to which I ascribe the evocation of helpful clues by the scientist&#x27;s imagination in the pursuit of an enquiry. But we must yet consider the fact that a scientist&#x27;s problem does not set him a definite task. He differs in this from the practical inventor and resembles rather the artist. He knows his aim only in broad terms and must rely on his sense of deepening coherence to guide him to discovery. He must keep his questing imagination fixed on these growing points and force his way to what lies hidden beyond them; let us see how this is done. Take once more the example of the way we discover how to see rightly through inverting spectacles. We cannot aim specifically ~&#x27; Vedysev and Karmanova (195811&#x27;.ersonal Communication by Mr. Jeffrey A. Gray, Institute of Experimental Psychology, Oxford, at re-connecting sight, touch, and hearing. Any attempt to overcome spacial inversion by telling ourself that what we see above is really below may actually hinder our progress, for the meaning of the words we would use were misleading. We must go on groping our way by sight and touch, and learn to get about in this way. Only by keeping our imagination fixed on the global result we are seeking, can we induce the requisite sensory reintegration, No quest could have been more indeterminate in its aim than Einstein&#x27;s enquiry that led to the discovery of relativity, Yet he has told that during all the years of his enquiry, &quot;there was a feeling of direction, of going straight towards something definite. Of course,&quot; he said, &quot;it is very hard to express that feeling in words; but it was definitely so, and clearly to be distinguished from later thoughts about the rational form of the solution.&quot; We meet here the integration of still largely unspecifiable elements into a gradually narrowing context, the coherence of which has not yet become explicit. The surmises made by Kepler during six years of toil before hitting on the elliptic path of Mars were often explicit. But Arthur Koestler has shown that Kepler&#x27;s distinctive guiding idea, to which he owed his success, was the firm conviction that the path of the planet Mars was somehow determined by a kind of mechanical inter- action with the sun. This vague vision - foreshadowing Newton&#x27;s theory - had enough truth in it to make him exclude all epicycles and send his imagination in search of a single formula, covering the whole planetary path both in its speed and in its shape. This is how Kepler hit upon his two laws of e]lipt:i.c revolut:i.on.</p>\n<p>I We begin to see now how the scientist&#x27;s surmises are formed. The imagination sallies forward and the intuitton fri~egrates what the imagination has lit upon. But a fundamental complication comes .into sight here. I have acknowledged that the final sanction of discovery lies in the sight of a c:oherence which our intuition detects and we accept as real; but history suggests that there are no universal standards for assessing sudh coherence: they have changed repeatedly during the past centuries. Copernicus criticised the Ptolemaic system for its inco- herence in assuming other than steady circular planetary paths and fought for the recognition of the heliocentric system as real, because of its superior consistency. But his follower, Kepler, abandoned the postulate of circular paths, as causing meaningless complications in the Copernican system, and boasted that by doing so * he had cleansed an Augean stable. Kepler based his first two laws on his vision that geometricil:l coherence is the product of some &gt;:c &gt;:c undefinable mechanical interaction; but this conception of reality underwent another radical transformation when Galileo, Descartes, and Newton found ultimate reality in the smallest particles of matter obeying the mathematical laws of mechanics. We must ask, therefore, by what standards we can change the very standards of coherence on which our convictions rest. On . what grounds can we change our grounds? We are faced with the existentialist dilemma, how values of our own choice can have authority over us who decreed them. * Arthur Koestler, The Sleepwalkers T19\u00bd1T;-p:- 334. ~&#x27;* Ibid., p. 316 We must look once more then at the mechanism by which imagination and i.ntuition carry out their joint task. We lift out:&#x27; arm and find that our imagination has issued a command which has evoked its implementation. But the moment feasibility is obstructed, a gap opens up between our faculties and the end at which we are aiming, and our imagination fixes on this gap and evokes attempts to reduce it. Such a quest can go on for years; it will be persistent, deliberate, and transitive; yet its whole purpose is directed on ourselves; it attempts to make us produce ideas. We say then that we are racking our brain or ransacking our brain; that we are cudgeling or ~king it, or beating our brain in trying to get it to work, And when such effort leads to success, the discovery induced in us by this ransacking is felt as something that is happening to us, We say that we tumble to an idea; or that an idea crosses our mind; or that it comes into our head; or that it strikes us; or dawns on us, or just presents itself to us. We are actually surprised and exclaim: Aha! when we suddenly have an idea. Ideas may indeed come to us unbidden, hours or even days after we have ceased to rack our brain. Discovery is made therefore in two moves: one deliberate, the otrh~r spontaneous, the spontaneous move being evoked in ourselves \\ _/ by the action of our deliberate effort. The deliberate thrust is a focal act of the imagination, while the spontaneous response to it, which brings discovery, belongs to the same class as the spontaneous co-ordination of muscles responding to our intention to lift our arm, or the spontaneous co-ordination of visual clues in response to our looking at something. This spontaneous act of discovery deserves to be recognised as the cr(;lat;t&#x27;ve intuition. / But where does this leave the creative imagination? It,is (&#x27; ., ~. \\&#x27; d there, it is not displaced by the intuition, it is imbued with it. When recognising a problem and engaging in its pursuit, our imagi- lr\\e ... &#x27; .. -~ 1,.._._, \u2022\u2022 &quot; - &#x27; _ , nation is gu:ided both by our dynamic and by our strategic intuition and it ransacks then our available faculties, guided by the cvii~tive ;intuition, The imaginative effort can evoke its own implementation only because it follows intuitive intimations of its own feasibility. Remember, as an analogy, that a lost memory can be brought back only if we have clues to it; we cannot even start racking our brain for a memory that is wholly forgotten. The imagination must attach itself to olues of feasibility supplied to it by the very intuition that it is seeking to evoke; sallies of the imagination that have no such guidance are idle fancies. The honours of creativity are due then in one part to the imagination, which demands of the intuition a feasible task and, in the other part, to the in~uition which rises to this task and reveals the discovery that the quest was due to bring forth. The intuition informs the imagination which, in response, evokes the powers of the intuition. But where does the responsibility for changing our criteria of reality rest then? To find that place we must probe still deeper. When the quest has ended, imagination and intuition do not v~nish from the scene. Our intuition recognises our final result to be valid and our imaginati6n points to the inexhaustible future mani- festations of it. We return to the quiescent state of mind from which the enquiry started, but return to it with a new vision of coherence and reality. Herein lies the final acceptance of this vision; any new standards of coherence implied in it have become our own standards, we are committed to them. But can this be true? In his treatise on The Concept of ~aw (Oxford 1961), Professor H. L.A. Hart observes rightly that, while it can be reasonable to decide that something will be illegal from tomorrow morning, it is nonsense to decide that something that is immoral today will be morally right from tomorrow. Morality, &#x27; Hart says, is &quot;immune against deliberate change&quot;; and the same holds clearly also for beauty and truth. Our allegiance to such standards implies that they are not of our making. The existentialist dilemma \\ still faces us then unresolved. But I shall deal with it now. The f~rst step is to remember that scientific discoveries are made in search of reality - of a reality that is there, whether we know it or not. The tea,:r,;ch is of our own making, but reality is not. We send out our imagination deliberately to ransack promising avenues, but the promise of these paths is already there to guide us, we sense it by our spontaneous intuitive powers. We induce the work of the intuition, but do not control its operations. And since our intuition works on a subsidiary level, neither the clues which it uses nor the principles by which it integrates them are fully known. It is difficult to tell what were the clues which convinced Copernicus that his system was real. We have seen that his vision was fraught with implications so far beyond his own ken that, h~. d they been shown to him, he would have rejected them. The discovery of relativity is just as full of unreconciled thoughts. Einstein tells in his autobiography that it was the example of the two great fundamental impossibilities underlying thermodynamics that suggested to him the absolute impossibility of observing absolute motion. But today we can see no connection at all between thermodynamics and relativity. Einstein acknowledged his debt to Mach and it is generally thought, therefore, that he con- firmed Mach&#x27;s thesis that the Newtonian doctrine of absolute rest is meaningless; but what Einstein actually proved was. on the contrary that Newton&#x27;s doctrine, far from being meaningless, was false. Again, Einstein&#x27;s re-definition of simultaneity originated modern operationa- lism; but he himself sharply opposed the way l1ach would replace the ~&#x27; conception of atoms by their directly observable manifestations. The solution of our problem is approaching here. For the latency of the principles entailed in a discovery indicates how we can change our standards and still uphold their authority over us. It suggests that while we cannot decree our standards explicitly, &#x27; . in the abstract, we may change them \u00b7covertly in practice. The deliberate aim of scientific enquiry is to solve a problem, but our intuition may respond to our efforts by a solution entailing new standards of coherence, new values. In affirming the solution we tacitly obey these new values and thus recognise their authority over ourselves,over us who tacitly conceived them, This is indeed how new values are introduced, whether in science, or in the arts, or in human relations. They enter subsi- diarily, embodied in creative action, Only after this can they be spelled out and professed in abstract terms and this makes them appear then to have been deliberately chosen, which is absurd. The actual grounds of a value, and its very meaning, will ever lie hidden ~&#x27; Albert Einstein, &quot;Biographical No1;es 11 in Albert Einstein Philosopher-Scientist, ed. P, A. Schilpp, NewYork (1949), p. 49, in the commitment which originally bore witness to that value. An explicit choice of new values is nonsensical. I shall speculate another time about the kind of universe which may ,justify our reliance on our truth-bearing intuitive powers; tonight I shall speak only of their part in our endorsement of scientific truth. A scientist&#x27;s originality lies in seeing a proble!Jl where others see none and finding a way to its pursuit where others lose their bearings. These acts of his mind are strictly personal, attributable to him and only to him. But they derive their power and receive their guidance from an aim that is impersonal. For the scientist&#x27;s quest pre-supposes the existence of an external reality. Research is conducted on these terms from the start and goes on then groping for a hidden truth towards which our clues are pointing; and when discovery terminates the pursuit its validity is sustained by a vision of reality pointing still further beyond it, Having relied throughout his enquiry on the presence of something real hidden out there, the scientist will necessarily rely on that external presence also for claiming the validity of the result that satisfies his quest. As he has accepted throughout the discipline which this external pole of his endeavour imposed upon him, he expects that others, similarly equipped, will likewise recognise the authority that guided him. On the grounds of the self-command which bound him to the quest of reality, he must claim that his results are universally valid; such is the universal intent of a scientific discovery. I speak not of universality, but of universal intent, for the scientist cannot know whether h:is claims will be accepted; they may be true and yet fail to carry conviction. He may have reason to expect that this is likely to happen. Nor can he regard a possible acceptance of his claims as a guarantee of their truth. To claim universal validity for a statement indicates merely that it ought to be accepted by all. The affirmation of scientific truth has an obligatory character which it shares with other valuations, declared universal by our own respect for them. Both the problem which anticipates discovery and discovery itself may be a delusion. But it is futile to seek for explicit impersonal criteria of their vaiidity. The content of any empirical statement is, as I have said, three times indeterminate. It relies on clues whj_ch are largely unspecifiab1e integrates them by principles which are undefinable, and speaks of a reality which is inexhaustible. Attempts to eliminate these indeterminacies of science merely replace science by a meaningless fiction. To accept science, in spite of its essential indeterminacies is an act of our personal judgment. It is to share the kind of commitment on which scientists enter by undertaking an enquiry. You cannot formalise commitment, for you cannot express your commitment non-commitally; to attempt this is to perform the kind of analysis which destroys its subject matter. We should be glad to recognise that science has come into existence by mental endowments akin to those in which all hopes of excellence are rooted, and that science rests ultimately on such intangible powers of our mind. This will help to restore legitimacy to our convictions, which the specious ideal of strict exactitude and detachment have discredited. These false ideals do no harm to physicists who only pay lip service to them, but they play havoc with other parts of science and with our whole culture, wh:l.ch try to live</p>\n<p>, ! 21 - by them, They will be well lost \u00a3or truer ideals 0\u00a3 science, which will show us once more \u00a3irst things \u00a3irst: the living above the inanimate, man above the animal, and man&#x27;s duties above man.</p>",

It \nshowed a number of instances in which we integrate experiences to \nsomething on which they bear. \nWe are aware then of such subsidiaries \nbe they clues, or parts, or pointers, or names, or tools, or probes, \nor motions, in terms of that to which they are directihg our attention, \nWe are aware for example of perceptual clues only in the appearance \nof things we are looking at. It is amazing at what speed such clues \nare integrated without being identifiable. \nSuch is the way subsidiaries are brought into action by \nour powers of tacit integration, and such is, I believe also, the \nway we discover coherence and reality in nature. \nThis is the idea \nI want to develop today. \nIf natural science is - as I assume it to be - a generalised \nform of perception, we might find the prototype of scientific dis-\ncovery in the way we solve a difficult perceptual problem. \nTake the \nway we learn to find our way about while wearing inverting spectacles. \nWhen you put on spectacles that show things upside down, you feel \ncompletely lost and remain helpless for days on end. \nBut if you \npersist in groping around for a week or more, you find your way again \nand eventually can even drive a car or climb rocks with the spectacles \non. \nThis fact, well known today, was discovered - in essence - by \nStratton seventy\u00b7years ago. It is usually said to show that after a \ntime the visual image switches round to the way we normally see it. \nifost of the literature says so. \nBut more recent observation has \nproved that this interpretation is false. \nIt happened, for example, that a person perfectly trained \nto get around with upside down spectacles, was shown a row of houses \nat a distance, and was asked whether he saw the houses right way up \nor upside down. \nThe question puzzled the subject and he replied, \nafter a moment, that he had not thought about the matter before, but \nthat now that he is asked about it he finds that he sees the houses \n* \nupside down. \nSuch a reply shows that the visual image of the houses has \nnot turned back to normal; \nit has remained inverted, but the in-\nverted image no longer means to the subject that the houses themselvee \nare upside down. \n( \" (., \n, \n\u00b7r C -1 \nThe invert~d image has been reconnected rationally \nto other sensory clues, to touch and sound, and weight. \nThese all \nhang together with the image once more in a way that though the image \nremains inverted we can again find our way by it safely. \nA new wav \nof seeing things rightly has been produced, a new sensory mode estab-\nlished. \nAnd since the m~3:i!ng of the upside down image has now \no~~ed, the term 'upside down' has lost its previous meaning, and \nit has become confusing to enquire whether something is seen upside \ndown or right way up. \nThe new kind of right seeing can be talked \nabout only in terms of a new vocabulary. \nI was told that in the \nPsychology Department at Innsbruck University where these results \n\u2022~ \nSee F. W. Snyder and N. H. Pronko, Vision with Spatj.al Inversion, \nWichita, Kansas (1952). \nFor fuller evidence and its interpretation \nin the sense given here, see Heinrich Kottenhoff, Was ist r.ichtige~ \nSehen mit lhnkehrbrillen und in welchem Sinne stellt sich das Sehen \n~? Psychologia Universalis, Vol. 5 (1961). \nwere first clearly developed by Heinrich Kottenhoff (around 1960), \nthey avoid confusion by applying the German words for right and left \nfor the ordinary seeing of things, but use the English words 'right' \nand 'left' when seeing things rightly through right-left inverting \nspectacles. \nWe may say that the wearer of inverting spectacles re-orga-\nnises scrambled clues into a new kind of coherence. \nHe again sees \nobjects then, instead of meaningless impressions. \nHe again sees \nreal things, which he can pick up and handle, which have weights \npulling in the right direction and make sounds that come from the \n< place at which he sees them. \nHe has made a novel sense out of chaos. \nIn science, I find the closes~~_p_a!'allel to this perceptual \nachievement in the discovery of relativity. Einstein has told the \nstory how from the age of 16 he was obsessed by the following type \nof speculation. \nExperiments with falling bodies were known to give \nthe same result on board a ship in motion as they do on solid ground. \nBut what would happen to the light which a lamp would emit on board \na moving ship? Supposing the ship moved fast enough, would it over-\ntake the beams of its own light, as a bullet overtakes its own sound \nby crossing the sonic barrier? Einstein thought that this was in-\nconceivable, and persisting in this assumption, he eventually suc-\nceeded in renewing the conceptions of space and time in a way which \nwould make it inconceivable for the ship to overtake, however slightly, \nits own light rays. \nAfter this, questions about a definite span of \ntime or space became meaningless and confusing - exactly as questions \nof \"above\" and 91below\" became 11LGAningless and con.fusing to a subject \n* \nwho had adapted his vision to inverting spectacles. \nIt is no accident that it is the most radical innovation \nin the history of science that appears most similar to the way we \nacquire the capacity for seeing inverted images rightly. \nFor only \na comprehensive problem, like relativity, can require that we reorga-\nnise such basic conceptions as we do in learning to see rightly \nthrough inverting spectacles. Relativity alone involves conceptual \ninnovations as strange and paradoxical as those we make in reorgani-\nsing an inverted vision. \nThe experimental verificationsof relativity have shown \nthat the coherence discerned by Einstein was real. \nOne of these \nconfirmations has a curious history. \nEinstein had assumed that a \n04t \nlight source would never overtake a beam sent/by it, a fact that \nhas already been established before by Michelson and Morley. \nIn \nhis autobiography Einstein says that he made this assumption intui-\ntively from the start, which is to say that he recognised it by an \nact of tacit knowing. \nBut this account failed to convince his con-\ntemporaries, for intuition was not regarded as a legitimate ground \nfor knowledge. \nText books of physics described, therefore, Einstein's \ntheory as his answer to the experiments of Michelson. \nWhen I tried \nto put the record right, by accepting Einstein's claim that he had \nintuitively - that is tacitly - recognised the facts already demon-\nstrated by Michelson, I was attacked and ridiculed by Professor \nGrUnbaum of Pittsburgh, who argued that Einstein must have known \nof Michelson's experiment, since he could not otherwise have based \n* References to Einstein's autobiography are based on Albert Einstein, \n\"Biographical Notes\" in Albert Einstein, Philosopher-Scientist, ed. \nP.A. Schilpp, New York, (I949) p. 53, \n* \nhimself on the facts established by these experiments. \nBut if science is a generalised form of perception, \nEinstein's story of his intuition is clear enough. \nHe had started \nfrom the principle that it is impossible to observe absolute motion \nin mechanics, and when he came across the question whether this prin-\nciple holds also when light is emitted, he felt that it must still \nhold, but he could not quite tell why he assumed this. \nThis is \nexactly how unaccountable assumptions are made in the way we perceive \nthings and these assumptions cah affect also the way scientists see \nthem. \nNewton's assumption of absolute rest 1 the assumption which \nEinstein was to refute, owed its convincing power to the way we \ncommonly see things. \nWe see a car travelling along a road and never \nthe road sliding away under the car. \nWe see the road at absolute \nrest. \nWe generally see things as we do, for this establishes co-\nherence within the context of our experience. \nSo when Einstein ex-\ntended his vision to the universe and included the case of a light \nsource emitting a beam, he could make sense of this only by seeing \nit in such a way that the beam was never overtaken, however slightly, \nby its source. \nThis is what he meant by saying that he knew intuiti-\nvely that this was in fact so. \nWe can understand now also why the grounds on which Coperni-\ncus claimed that his system was real could be convincing to him, though \n1 not convincing to others. \nWe have seen that the tacit powers that \n/ \nare at work in perception integrate clues which, being subsidiarily \nknown, are largely unspecifiable; \nwe have seen further that the \nintuition by which Einstein shaped his novel conceptions of time and \nspace was also based on clues which were largely unspecifiable; \nwe \n* Adolf GrUnbaum, Philosophical Problems of Space and Time, New \nYork (1963), pp. 378-85. \nmay assume then that this was true also for Cpernicus shaping his \nvision of reality, \nAnd we may sum up by saying. Science is based on.clu~ \n-~ \nthat have a bearing on reality. \nThese clues are not fully specifia-\nble; \nnor is the process of integration \\4hich connects them fully \ndefinable; \nwhile the future manifestations of the reality indicated \nby this coherence are inexhaustible, \nThese three indeterminacies \ndefeat any attempt at a strict theory of scientific validity and prove \nindispensahle the powers of tacit knowing. \n* \nThis gives us a general idea of the way scientific know-\nledge is established at the end of an enquiry; it tells us how we \njudge that our result is coherent and real, \nBut it does not show \nclearly how we start an enquiry; \nnor how we know, once we have \nstarted, which way to turn for a solution. \nAt the beginning of a \nquest we can know only vaguely what we may hope to discover; it may \nseem strange, therefore, how we can ever start off and go on with an \nenquiry without lc11owing what exactly we are looking for, \nThis question goes back to antiquity. \nPlato set it in the \nMeno. \nHe said, in effect, that if we know the solution of a problem, \nthere is no problem - and if we don't know the solution, we do not \nknow what we are looking for and cannot expect to find anything. \nHe \nconcluded that when we do solve problems, we do it by remembering past \nincarnations. \nThis strange solution of the dilemma may have pre~ \n,! f \n: ' \n, '- \u00b7V ' \u2022- -1-~~', (' \nvented it from being taken seriously. \nYet the problem is ineluctable \nand can be answered only by recognising a kind of tacit knowing or \nintuition, that is more dynamic than the one I have dwellt on so far. \nI have spoken repeatedly of our powers to perceive a \n\nI \ncoherence bearing on reality, with its hidden future manifestations, \nAnd I have mentioned in my first lecture also a more specific know-\nledge of hidden coherence: \nthe kind of foreknowledge we have in a \nproblem. \nAnd we know that the scientist's imagination sees problems, \nproduces hunches, and, stirred by these anticipations, pursues his \nquest towards them. \nWe may say that this quest is guided at every \nstage by feelings of a deepening coherence, of feelings that have a \nfair chance of proving right. \nWe may recognise in them the working \nof a dynamic intuition: \nin other words, the power which achieves \ntac~t- knowledge. \nThe mechanism of this power can be illuminated by an \nanalogy, \nPhysics speaks of potential energy that is released when \na weight slides down a slope. \nOur search for deeper coherence is \nguided likewise by a potentiality. \nWe feel the slope towards deeper \ninsight.as we feel the direction in which a heavy weight is pulled \nalong a steep incline. \nThis is the dynamic intuition that guides \nthe pursuit of discovery. \nThat is how I would resolve the paradox of the Meno: \nwe \ncan pursue scientific discovery without knowing what we are looking \n.,/for, because the gradient of deepening coherence tells us where to \nstart and which way to turn, and eventually brings us to the point \nwhere we may stop and claim a discovery. \nThe resemblance to the way \nthe painter or the poet are guided by the hidden coherence they are \nseeking seems clear. \nBut we must yet acknowledge further powers of intuition \nwithout which scientists or inventors could neither rationally choose \na particular problem nor pursue any chosen problem successfully. \nThink of Stratton devising his clumsy inverting spectacles and then \ngroping about guided by the inverted vision of a single narrowly \nrestricted eye for days on end. \nHe must have been firmly convinced \nthat he would learn to find his way about within reasonable time, \nand also that the result would be worth all the trouble of his strange \nenterprise - and he proved right. \nOr think of Einstein, when as a \nboy he came across the speculative dilemma of a light source pur-\nsuing its own ray. \nHe did not brush the matter aside as a mere \noddity, as anybody else would have done. \nHis intuition told him that \nthere must exist a principle which would assure the impossibility of \nobserving absolute motion in any circumstances. \nThrough years of \nsometimes despairing enquiry, he kept up his conviction that the \ndiscovery he was seeking was within his ultimate reach and that it \nwould prove worth the torment of its pursuit; \nand again, Einstein \nproved right. \nKepler too might have reasonably concluded, after \nsome five years of vain efforts, that he was wasting his time, but \nhe persisted and proved right. \nThe-power by which such long range assessments are made \nmay be called a strategic intuition. It is practised every day on \na high level of responsibility in industrial research laboratories. \nThe director of such a laboratory does not usually make inventions, \nbut is responsible for assessing the value of problems suggested to \nhim, be it from outside or by members of his laboratory. \nFor each \nsuch problem the director must jointly estimate the chances of its \nsuccessful pursuit, the value of its possible solution, and also \nthe costs of achieving it. He must compare this combination with \nthe joint assessment of the same characteristics for rival problems. \nOn these grounds he has to decide whether the pursuit of a problem \nshould be undertaken or not, and if undertaken, what grade of priority \nshould be given to it in the use of available resources, \nThe scientist is faced with similar decisions. \nAn intuition \nthat merely points out a number of problems does not tell him which \nproblem to choose. \nHe must be able to estimate the gap separating \nhimJ:rom discovery and he must also be able roughly to assess whether \nthe importance of a possible discovery would warrant the investment \nof the powers and resources needed for its pursuit. \nWithout this \nkind of strategic intuition, he would waste his opportunities on \nwild goose chases and be soon out of a job. \nThe kinds of intuition I have recognised here are the \ndynamic forms of tacit knowing. \nSuch an intuition is quite different \nfrom the supreme immediate knowledge called intuition by Leibniz or \nSpinoza or Husserl. It is a skill for guessing with a reasonable \n/ chance of guessing right; \na skill guided by an innate sensitivity \nto coherence, improved by schooling. \nThe fact that this faculty \noften fails does not discredit it; \na method for guessing ten percent \nabove average chance on roulette would be worth millions. \nOf the \ninfallible intuition of idealistic philosophy I know nothing and I \ndoubt that it exists. \nBut to know what to look for does not lend us the power to \nseek it and find it, \nI have spoken in my first lecture of the way \nthe anticipatory powers of the scientist's imagination sees a problem; \nI must work out now more generally the part played by the imagination \nin the dynamics of tacit knowing. \nAll thoughts of things that are not present, or of things \nnot vet present - or perhaps never to be present - all such thoughts \nI shall call acts of the imagination. \nWhen I intent! to lift my arm, \nthis intention is an act of my imagination. \nIn this case imagining \nis not visual but muscular. \nAn athlete keyed up for a high jump is \nengaged in an intense act of muscular imagination. \nBut even in the \neffortless lifting of an arm, we can recognise a conscious iinteption, \n-- ~--\u00b7-\nand an act of the imagination, distinct from its muscular execution. \nFor we never decree the muscular performance itself, since we have \nno direct control over it. This delicately co-ordinated feat of \nmuscular contractions is ordered spontaneously, in response to our \nimaginative act of volition. \nThis dual structure of deliberate movement was first des-\ncribed by William James seventy years ago. \nWe see now that it \ncorresponds to the two kinds of awareness that we have met in all \ntacit knowing. \nWe may say that we have a focal awareness of: lifting \nour arm, and that this focal act is implemented by the ,integration \nof subsidiary muscular particulars. \nWe may put it as in the case \nof perception, that we are focally aware of a deliberate achievement \nand aware of its particulars only subsidiarily, by attending to that \nwhich they jointly constitute. \nBut a new life, a new intensity, enters into this two-\nlevelled structure the moment our intention meets with difficulties. \nThe two levels fall apart then and the imagination sallies forward, \nseeking to close the gap between them. \nTake the example of learning \nto ride a bicycle. \nOur imagination is fixed on this aim, but our \npresent capabilities being insufficient, our execution of it falls \nhehind. \nBy straining every nerve to close this gap, we gradually \nlearn to keep our balance on a bicycle. \nWe find that such an effort results in an amazingly \nsophisticated policy of which we know nothing. \nOur muscles are set \n\n- 11 \nA \nso as to counteract at every moment our accidental imbalance, by \nturning the bicycle into a curve with a radius proportional to the \nsquare of its velocity, divided by the angle of our imbalance. \n' \nMillions of people are cycling all over the world by skilfully \napplying this formula which they could not remotely understand if \nthey were told about it, This puzzling fact is explained by the \ni \ntwo-levelled structure of intentional action~ as follows. \nThe use of \nthe formula is invented on the subsidiary level in response to the \nefforts to close the gap between intention and performance; \nand \nsince the performance has been produced subsidiarily, it may remain \nfocally unknown. \nRemember also Hefferline's experiments showing how an \nactive intention can evoke covertly, inside our body, the means of \nits implementation. \nThere is a detail of thE experiment I have not \ntold you about, \nSpontaneous muscular twitches, imperceptible to \nthe subject, were rewarded by a brief pause in an unpleasant noise; \nand as soon as this was done, the frequency of the twitches multiplied \n! \nabout threefold. \nAnd when in some cases the subject was shown on \na galvanometer the electrical effect of his twitches, the frequency \nt,, \nof the twitches shot up to about six times their normal rate. \nFor \nyears I have been puzzled by this effect, until it dawned upon me \nthat the galvanometer readings support the subject's int'ention, by \nserving him as a guide to his imagination. \nI have found this effect \nconfirmed in a number of other experiments by various psychologists. \n* See R. F. Hefferline et al. Science ITT59) Vol. 130, pp. 1338-9, \nSee also Science (1963) Vol. 139, pp. 834-5 and R. F. Hefferline \n\"Learning Theory and Clinical Psychology\" in Expe~imental Foundations \nof Clinical Psychology, ed. A. J, Bachrach, New York (1962). \nRecent work in Russia has shown that the sight or sound \nof a novel intriguing kind evokes a general mobilisation of internal \nbodily processes. \nSuch internal responses are found in animals right \ndown to fishes. \nThey have been called an orientgtign re.tllex and \n/ \n. \nmay be taken to signify the excitement of meeting a problem. \nIf the \nproblem is unpleasant and one of the mobilised internal events chances \nto bring it under control, this event will be repeated more frequently, \nas Hefferline 1s twitches were, \nIf, on the other hand, the problem \nturns out to be of no consequence, habituation will set in: the \nanimal will cease to worry, Rabbits show habituation after 6 to 15 \npresentations of a strange sight, but birds take longer and carps \nmay cease to get excited only after seeing a problematic sight 170 \n* \ntimes. \nThey are an ideal audience for telling it the same joke \nover and over again. \nThis is the kind of mechanism to which I ascribe the \nevocation of helpful clues by the scientist's imagination in the \npursuit of an enquiry. \nBut we must yet consider the fact that a \nscientist's problem does not set him a definite task. \nHe differs \nin this from the practical inventor and resembles rather the artist. \nHe knows his aim only in broad terms and must rely on his sense of \ndeepening coherence to guide him to discovery. \nHe must keep his \nquesting imagination fixed on these growing points and force his \nway to what lies hidden beyond them; \nlet us see how this is done. \nTake once more the example of the way we discover how to \nsee rightly through inverting spectacles. \nWe cannot aim specifically \n~' \nVedysev and Karmanova (195811'.ersonal Communication by Mr. Jeffrey \nA. Gray, Institute of Experimental Psychology, Oxford, \nat re-connecting sight, touch, and hearing. \nAny attempt to overcome \nspacial inversion by telling ourself that what we see above is really \nbelow may actually hinder our progress, for the meaning of the words \nwe would use were misleading. \nWe must go on groping our way by sight \nand touch, and learn to get about in this way. \nOnly by keeping our \nimagination fixed on the global result we are seeking, can we induce \nthe requisite sensory reintegration, \nNo quest could have been more indeterminate in its aim than \nEinstein's enquiry that led to the discovery of relativity, \nYet he \nhas told that during all the years of his enquiry, \"there was a \nfeeling of direction, of going straight towards something definite. \nOf course,\" he said, \"it is very hard to express that feeling in \nwords; \nbut it was definitely so, and clearly to be distinguished \nfrom later thoughts about the rational form of the solution.\" \nWe \nmeet here the integration of still largely unspecifiable elements \ninto a gradually narrowing context, the coherence of which has not \nyet become explicit. \nThe surmises made by Kepler during six years of toil before \nhitting on the elliptic path of Mars were often explicit. \nBut Arthur \nKoestler has shown that Kepler's distinctive guiding idea, to which \nhe owed his success, was the firm conviction that the path of the \nplanet Mars was somehow determined by a kind of mechanical inter-\naction with the sun. \nThis vague vision - foreshadowing Newton's \ntheory - had enough truth in it to make him exclude all epicycles \nand send his imagination in search of a single formula, covering \nthe whole planetary path both in its speed and in its shape. \nThis \nis how Kepler hit upon his two laws of e]lipt:i.c revolut:i.on. \n\nI \nWe begin to see now how the scientist's surmises are \nformed. \nThe imagination sallies forward and the intuitton fri~egrates \nwhat the imagination has lit upon. \nBut a fundamental complication \ncomes .into sight here. \nI have acknowledged that the final sanction \nof discovery lies in the sight of a c:oherence which our intuition \ndetects and we accept as real; \nbut history suggests that there are \nno universal standards for assessing sudh coherence: \nthey have \nchanged repeatedly during the past centuries. \nCopernicus criticised the Ptolemaic system for its inco-\nherence in assuming other than steady circular planetary paths and \nfought for the recognition of the heliocentric system as real, \nbecause of its superior consistency. \nBut his follower, Kepler, \nabandoned the postulate of circular paths, as causing meaningless \ncomplications in the Copernican system, and boasted that by doing so \n* \nhe had cleansed an Augean stable. \nKepler based his first two laws \non his vision that geometricil:l coherence is the product of some \n>:c >:c \nundefinable mechanical interaction; \nbut this conception of reality \nunderwent another radical transformation when Galileo, Descartes, \nand Newton found ultimate reality in the smallest particles of matter \nobeying the mathematical laws of mechanics. \nWe must ask, therefore, by what standards we can change \nthe very standards of coherence on which our convictions rest. \nOn \n. what grounds can we change our grounds? \nWe are faced with the \nexistentialist dilemma, how values of our own choice can have \nauthority over us who decreed them. \n* Arthur Koestler, The Sleepwalkers T19\u00bd1T;-p:- 334. \n~'* Ibid., p. 316 \nWe must look once more then at the mechanism by which \nimagination and i.ntuition carry out their joint task. \nWe lift out:' \narm and find that our imagination has issued a command which has \nevoked its implementation. \nBut the moment feasibility is obstructed, \na gap opens up between our faculties and the end at which we are \naiming, and our imagination fixes on this gap and evokes attempts \nto reduce it. Such a quest can go on for years; it will be persistent, \ndeliberate, and transitive; \nyet its whole purpose is directed on \nourselves; it attempts to make us produce ideas. \nWe say then that \nwe are racking our brain or ransacking our brain; that we are \ncudgeling or ~king it, or beating our brain in trying to get it to \nwork, \nAnd when such effort leads to success, the discovery induced \nin us by this ransacking is felt as something that is happening to us, \nWe say that we tumble to an idea; \nor that an idea crosses our mind; \nor that it comes into our head; \nor that it strikes us; \nor dawns on \nus, or just presents itself to us. \nWe are actually surprised and \nexclaim: \nAha! when we suddenly have an idea. \nIdeas may indeed come \nto us unbidden, hours or even days after we have ceased to rack our \nbrain. \nDiscovery is made therefore in two moves: \none deliberate, \nthe otrh~r spontaneous, the spontaneous move being evoked in ourselves \n\\ \n_/ \nby the action of our deliberate effort. \nThe deliberate thrust is a \nfocal act of the imagination, while the spontaneous response to it, \nwhich brings discovery, belongs to the same class as the spontaneous \nco-ordination of muscles responding to our intention to lift our \narm, or the spontaneous co-ordination of visual clues in response to \nour looking at something. \nThis spontaneous act of discovery deserves \nto be recognised as the cr(;lat;t've intuition. \n/ \nBut where does this leave the creative imagination? It,is \n(' ., ~. \\' d \nthere, it is not displaced by the intuition, it is imbued with it. \nWhen recognising a problem and engaging in its pursuit, our imagi-\nlr\\e ... ' .. -~ 1,.._._, \u2022\u2022 \" \n-\n' \n_ \n, \nnation is gu:ided both by our dynamic and by our strategic intuition \nand it ransacks then our available faculties, guided by the cvii~tive \n;intuition, \nThe imaginative effort can evoke its own implementation \nonly because it follows intuitive intimations of its own feasibility. \nRemember, as an analogy, that a lost memory can be brought back only \nif we have clues to it; \nwe cannot even start racking our brain for \na memory that is wholly forgotten. \nThe imagination must attach itself \nto olues of feasibility supplied to it by the very intuition that it \nis seeking to evoke; \nsallies of the imagination that have no such \nguidance are idle fancies. \nThe honours of creativity are due then in one part to the \nimagination, which demands of the intuition a feasible task and, \nin the other part, to the in~uition which rises to this task and \nreveals the discovery that the quest was due to bring forth. \nThe \nintuition informs the imagination which, in response, evokes the \npowers of the intuition. \nBut where does the responsibility for changing our criteria \nof reality rest then? \nTo find that place we must probe still deeper. \nWhen the quest has ended, imagination and intuition do not v~nish \nfrom the scene. \nOur intuition recognises our final result to be \nvalid and our imaginati6n points to the inexhaustible future mani-\nfestations of it. \nWe return to the quiescent state of mind from \nwhich the enquiry started, but return to it with a new vision of \ncoherence and reality. \nHerein lies the final acceptance of this \nvision; \nany new standards of coherence implied in it have become \nour own standards, we are committed to them. \nBut can this be true? In his treatise on The Concept of \n~aw (Oxford 1961), Professor H. L.A. Hart observes rightly that, \nwhile it can be reasonable to decide that something will be illegal \nfrom tomorrow morning, it is nonsense to decide that something that \nis immoral today will be morally right from tomorrow. \nMorality, \n' \nHart says, is \"immune against deliberate change\"; \nand the same holds \nclearly also for beauty and truth. \nOur allegiance to such standards \nimplies that they are not of our making. \nThe existentialist dilemma \n\\ still faces us then unresolved. \nBut I shall deal with it now. \nThe f~rst step is to \nremember that scientific discoveries are made in search of reality -\nof a reality that is there, whether we know it or not. \nThe tea,:r,;ch \nis of our own making, but reality is not. \nWe send out our imagination \ndeliberately to ransack promising avenues, but the promise of these \npaths is already there to guide us, we sense it by our spontaneous \nintuitive powers. \nWe induce the work of the intuition, but do not \ncontrol its operations. \nAnd since our intuition works on a subsidiary level, \nneither the clues which it uses nor the principles by which it \nintegrates them are fully known. \nIt is difficult to tell what were \nthe clues which convinced Copernicus that his system was real. \nWe \nhave seen that his vision was fraught with implications so far beyond \nhis own ken that, h~. d they been shown to him, he would have rejected \nthem. \nThe discovery of relativity is just as full of unreconciled \nthoughts. \nEinstein tells in his autobiography that it was the \nexample of the two great fundamental impossibilities underlying \nthermodynamics that suggested to him the absolute impossibility of \nobserving absolute motion. \nBut today we can see no connection at all \nbetween thermodynamics and relativity. Einstein acknowledged his \ndebt to Mach and it is generally thought, therefore, that he con-\nfirmed Mach's thesis that the Newtonian doctrine of absolute rest \nis meaningless; \nbut what Einstein actually proved was. on the contrary \nthat Newton's doctrine, far from being meaningless, was false. \nAgain, \nEinstein's re-definition of simultaneity originated modern operationa-\nlism; \nbut he himself sharply opposed the way l1ach would replace the \n~' \nconception of atoms by their directly observable manifestations. \nThe solution of our problem is approaching here. \nFor the \nlatency of the principles entailed in a discovery indicates how we \ncan change our standards and still uphold their authority over us. \nIt suggests that while we cannot decree our standards explicitly, \n' \n. \nin the abstract, we may change them \u00b7covertly in practice. \nThe \ndeliberate aim of scientific enquiry is to solve a problem, but our \nintuition may respond to our efforts by a solution entailing new \nstandards of coherence, new values. \nIn affirming the solution we \ntacitly obey these new values and thus recognise their authority \nover ourselves,over us who tacitly conceived them, \nThis is indeed how new values are introduced, whether in \nscience, or in the arts, or in human relations. \nThey enter subsi-\ndiarily, embodied in creative action, \nOnly after this can they be \nspelled out and professed in abstract terms and this makes them \nappear then to have been deliberately chosen, which is absurd. \nThe \nactual grounds of a value, and its very meaning, will ever lie hidden \n~' Albert Einstein, \"Biographical No1;es 11 in Albert Einstein \nPhilosopher-Scientist, ed. P, A. Schilpp, NewYork (1949), p. 49, \nin the commitment which originally bore witness to that value. \nAn \nexplicit choice of new values is nonsensical. \nI shall speculate another time about the kind of universe \nwhich may ,justify our reliance on our truth-bearing intuitive powers; \ntonight I shall speak only of their part in our endorsement of \nscientific truth. \nA scientist's originality lies in seeing a proble!Jl \nwhere others see none and finding a way to its pursuit where others \nlose their bearings. \nThese acts of his mind are strictly personal, \nattributable to him and only to him. \nBut they derive their power \nand receive their guidance from an aim that is impersonal. \nFor the \nscientist's quest pre-supposes the existence of an external reality. \nResearch is conducted on these terms from the start and goes on then \ngroping for a hidden truth towards which our clues are pointing; \nand \nwhen discovery terminates the pursuit its validity is sustained by a \nvision of reality pointing still further beyond it, \nHaving relied throughout his enquiry on the presence of \nsomething real hidden out there, the scientist will necessarily \nrely on that external presence also for claiming the validity of \nthe result that satisfies his quest. \nAs he has accepted throughout \nthe discipline which this external pole of his endeavour imposed \nupon him, he expects that others, similarly equipped, will likewise \nrecognise the authority that guided him. \nOn the grounds of the \nself-command which bound him to the quest of reality, he must claim \nthat his results are universally valid; \nsuch is the universal intent \nof a scientific discovery. \nI speak not of universality, but of universal intent, for \nthe scientist cannot know whether h:is claims will be accepted; \nthey \nmay be true and yet fail to carry conviction. \nHe may have reason \nto expect that this is likely to happen. \nNor can he regard a \npossible acceptance of his claims as a guarantee of their truth. \nTo claim universal validity for a statement indicates merely that \nit ought to be accepted by all. The affirmation of scientific truth \nhas an obligatory character which it shares with other valuations, \ndeclared universal by our own respect for them. \nBoth the problem which anticipates discovery and discovery \nitself may be a delusion. \nBut it is futile to seek for explicit \nimpersonal criteria of their vaiidity. \nThe content of any empirical \nstatement is, as I have said, three times indeterminate. It relies \non clues whj_ch are largely unspecifiab1e \nintegrates them by \nprinciples which are undefinable, and speaks of a reality which is \ninexhaustible. \nAttempts to eliminate these indeterminacies of science \nmerely replace science by a meaningless fiction. \nTo accept science, in spite of its essential indeterminacies \nis an act of our personal judgment. It is to share the kind of \ncommitment on which scientists enter by undertaking an enquiry. \nYou \ncannot formalise commitment, for you cannot express your commitment \nnon-commitally; \nto attempt this is to perform the kind of analysis \nwhich destroys its subject matter. \nWe should be glad to recognise that science has come into \nexistence by mental endowments akin to those in which all hopes of \nexcellence are rooted, and that science rests ultimately on such \nintangible powers of our mind. \nThis will help to restore legitimacy \nto our convictions, which the specious ideal of strict exactitude \nand detachment have discredited. \nThese false ideals do no harm to \nphysicists who only pay lip service to them, but they play havoc with \nother parts of science and with our whole culture, wh:l.ch try to live \n\n, \n! \n21 -\nby them, \nThey will be well lost \u00a3or truer ideals 0\u00a3 science, which \nwill show us once more \u00a3irst things \u00a3irst: \nthe living above the \ninanimate, man above the animal, and man's duties above man.",

    "content_html": "<p>, 1)- l&#x27; - &#x27; &#x27;&#x27; Lecture 4 The Growth of Science in Society by Michael Polanyi (Delivered at Wesleyan University; October 28, 1965) The purpose of my lecture today is two-pronged. I want to outline the way scientific research is organised, and must be organised And for this purpose I shall have to speak again of the grounds on whi_ch science rests and the way in which discoveries are made. I shall use as my starting point a notorious conflict bet- ween the scientific world and a considerable part of the lay public. I shall tell you how this controversy has recently led a distinguished group of sociologists to pronounce a wholesale condemnation of scien- tific procedures and I shall try then to resolve this situation by applying my own views on the nature of scientific discovery. This shall lead us then to a general theory of scientific life: of dis- cipline and freedom in scientific institutions, The current situation in the philosophy of science is a strange one, The movement of logical positivism, which aimed at a strict definition of validity and meaning, reached the height of its claims and prestige about twenty years ago. Since then it has become clearer year by year that this aim was unattainable. But since (to my knowledge) no alternative has been offered to the desired strict criteria of scientific truth, we have no accepted theory of scientific knowledge today. Most writers on science have accepted science as an un- questionable fact which is not in need of philosophic justification nor capable of justification. - You will rarely find this spelled out, but it is confirmed by current practice. Take a widely accepted account of science in Ernest Nagel&#x27;s Structure of Science (1961), He writes that we do not know, whether the premisses assumed in the explanation of the sciences are true; and were the requirement that they be known to be true adopted, most of the widely accepted expla- nations in current science would have to be rejected as unsatisfactory. In other words, we must save our belief in the truth of scientific explanations by refraining to ask what they are based upon. Scien- tific truth is defined then as that which scientists say or think to be true. Yet this lack of philosophic justification has not damaged the public authority of science, but rather increased it. Modern philosophers have played down this shortcoming, by declaring that the claims of science are only tentative and ever open to refutation by adverse evidence. And this added to the authority of science. It was taken to show that, while scientific knowledge was supremely re- liable, scientists were at the same time supremely open-minded, setting an example of incomparable modesty and tolerance, Yet there have been some occasions in this century when the very foundations of science have been challenged. Sporadic attacks came in the form of laws against teaching the theory of evolution and in a papal encyclical warning against this theory. An attack on a broad front was made by the Soviet Union. But a more recent and personal challenge to the foundations of science came from Dr. Velikovsky&#x27;s highly unorthodox book Worlds in Collision published about fifteen years ago. Though emphatically rejected by scientists, it had a wide response among the lay public, who much resented the summary dismissal of the book by the experts. Then, some three years ago, new evidence turned up supporting Velikovsky&#x27;s theory, but this was again bluntly rejected by scientists. This seemed utterly unjustified to many people and a group of sociologists took up the matter. They launched a systematic attack in the American Behavioral Scientist under the leadership of its Editor, Professor de Grazia, on the whole procedure by which contributions to science are tested, accepted or rejected. A few words may cover for my present purpose Velikovsky&#x27;s theory, since its truth or falsity will not be at issue. His theory is based on the acceptance of evidence from the Old Testament, the Hindu Vedas and Greek Roman mythology about the occurrence of cata- strophic events in the earth1s history from the fifteenth to the seventh century B.C. It interprets these disasters and upheavals as due to the repeated passage of the earth through the tail of a comet. This comet he claims, subsequently collided with Mars and by losing its tail transformed its head into the planet Venus. Further terrestrial upheavals ensued when in the year 687 B,C. Mars nearly collided with the earth; on one occasion the earth turned completely over, so that the sun rose in the west and set in the east. To account for these events Velikovsky supplements Newtonian gravitation by the assumption of powerful electrical and magnetic fields acting between planets. As I said before, these ideas were rejected by astronomers, but appealed to a wide circle of laymen: the book became actually a best seller. And so bitter was the reaction of astronomers and other scientists to this, and the pressure they exercised, such that MacMillan&#x27;s who had publiehed v~likovsky&#x27;s book, felt compelled to give up their rights in it and passed them on to Doubleday&#x27;s who felt less vulnerable by the hostility of scientific opinion. When eventually in September 1963 the American Behavioral Scientist published its protest against the tre~tment of Velikovsky, the editor, Alfred de Grazia, Professor of Government in New York University, stated the aim of the enquiry to be undertaken as follows: &quot;The central problems are clear: Who determines scientific truth? What is their warrant?&quot; and he adds that &quot;some judg\u00b5ient must be passed upon the behavior of scientists and, if adverse, some remedies must be proposed,&quot; Referring to the three articles in this issue of his journal de Grazia went on to say that! 11if the judgment of the authors is correct, the scientific establishment is gravely inadequate to its professed aims, commits ihjustices as~ matter of course, and is badly in need of research and reform.&quot; If we accepted the positivist critique of science which leaves us today no other ultimate criterion of a scientific teaching, as that scientists accept it as valid, the answer to de Grazia&#x27;s first question, Who determines scientific truth? would be: &quot;The scientists.&quot; And to the second question, What is their warrant? we would answer that the decisions of scientists cannot be accounted for. But this is not satisfactory. We must be able to ask whethe. the reception of Velikovsky&#x27;s ideas by scientists was fair, and, if not, what went wrong? Professor de Grazia sets out five points of a rational procedure for testing a proposed contribution to science. First, a contribution must not be rejected unread; second, it may claim to be tested and publicly discussed with its author; if it suggests radical innovations, this should be welcomed fourth, if its ideas were at first rejected, they should have a chance to return with additional proof and once more be cordially examined; and fifth, should no authority/prevail against experimental evidence. Professor de Grazia shows that all these rules were broken in Velikovsky&#x27;s treatment by scientists. His work was condemned as utter nonsense by distinguished astronomers who frankly said they had not read his book. He asked to be admitted to a public discussion of his views and this was refused. He had concluded that the surface of Venus was hot and its atmosphere heavy with hydrocarbons, He asked the Harvard Observatory to test this prediction and this was refused. This happened in 1946; in February 1963 the American space explorer, Mariner II, confirmed Velikovsky&#x27;s predictions about Venus: its surface temperature was 800\u00b0 F. and its clouds replete with hydrocarbons. But this striking success of the theory did not succeed in causing its discussion to be reopened by scientists; it was rated as a curious coincidence, Authority prevailed against facts. I think it is understandable that Professor de Grazia was disappointed by the failure of scientists to live up to their pro- fessions of giving a ready hearing to any new ideas and submitting humbly to the test of any evidence contradicting their current views. No wonder perhaps that he went on then to affirm that the acceptance of new contributions by science does in fact not depend on the eviden- ce of its truth, but takes place either at random, or in the service of ruling powers, or responding to economic or political interests, or simply as dictated by accepted dogma, He was certainly right in contrasting the principles which scientists profess to follow in dealing with a novel contribution to science, with the way they actually treated Velikovsky&#x27;s ideas. But the situation changes if these principles are qualified by their tacit assumptions, This is what I propose to do now; and once done, this should resolve also the dilemma produced by the modern philosophic critique of science. It will show that this critique leads to absurd results because in its search for strictly definable criteria of scientific truth it necessarily overlooks the tacit principles on which science is actually founded. A vital judgment practiced in science which is manifestly informal, is the assessment of plausibility, Only plausible ideas are taken up, discussed and tested by scientists. Such a decision may later be proved right, but at the time that it is made, the assessment of plausibility is based on a broad exercise of intuition guided by many subtle indications, and is thus manifestly undemonstr- able. To show what I mean I shall recall an example of a claim lacking plausibility to the point of being absurd, which I picked up twenty five years ago in a letter published in Nature, The author of this letter had observed that the average gestation period of different animals ranging from rabbits to cows was an integer multiple ,~=-&#x27; of the number // The evidence he produced was ample, the agreement good, Yet the acceptance of this contribution by the journal was only meant as a joke, No amount of evidence could convince a modern ,.---, biologist that gestation periods are equal to integer multiples of II \u2022 Our conception of the nature of things tells us that such a relation- ship is absurd. A more technical example from physics can be found in a paper by Lord Raleigh published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society in 1947, It described some fairly simple experiments which proved in the author&#x27;s opinion that a hydrogen atom impinging on a metal wire could transmit to it energies ranging to a hundred electron- volts, Such an observation, if correct, would be far more revolu- tionary than the discovery of atomic fission by Otto Hahn in 1939, Yet when this paper appeared and I asked various physicists&#x27; opinions about it, they only shrugged their shoulders. They could not find fault with the experiment, yet they not only did not believe its results, but not even thought it worthwhile to consider what was wrong with it, let alone check upon it. They just ignored it. About ten years later some experiments were brought to my notice which I accidentally offered an explanation of Lord Raleigh&#x27;s findings. His results were apparently due to some hidden factors of no great interest, but which he could hardly have identified at the time. He should have ignored his observation, as his colleagues were quite rightly to do. In my early writings I have also described how the possible reality of a certain type of observations which had long been denied, was for a time accepted, then again rejected, only to be soon accepted again and presently rejected once more, these two consecutive alter- nations of acceptance and rejection taking place within 25 years. The observations in question were the apparent transformations of elements. Ever since the immutability of elements had been accepted, such observations have been cast aside as dirt effects, but after Rutherford and Soddy established the fact of radioactive disintegra- tion, they were taken seriously and accepted for publication, but disappeared from journals again, as it was recognised that radio- activity occurs only in very few comparatively rare elements. New reports of apparently well authenticated cases appeared in journals once more in response to Rutherford&#x27;s discovery of artificial dis- integration of elements, and these presently vanished again as the nature of such disintegration became clear and showed that it could not happen in a chemical laboratory. These apparent chemical trans- formations of elements must again continue to turn up, but are un~ hesitatingly ignored once more as they had been all along until the advent of radioactivity. Suppose then that Velikovsky&#x27;s claims were as unplausible .,,-- as the parallelism between periods of gestation and the number if ; or as unplausible as Lord Raleigh&#x27;s results published in the Pro- ceedings of the Royal Society; orj again, as unplausible as the chemical transformation of elements appears to be now - or if it were to appear even more absurd than these possibilities do - then it would certainly correspond to the current custom of science to reject them at a glance unread, and to refuse discussing them publicly with the author. Indeed, to drop one&#x27;s work in order to test some of the claims of Velikovsky as requested by him, would appear a culpable waste of time, of expense and of effort. But how about the predictions of Velikovsky which came true? Should these not have caused his book to be reconsidered? No, a theory rejected as absurd will not always be made plausible by the confirmation of some of its predictions. The fate of Eddington&#x27;s cosmic theories may illustrate this. Far back in 1946 I put on re- cord an anxious remark by a dinstinguished mathematician, (then pro- fessor at the University of Manchester), who complained that recent measurements had much strengthened the evidence for Eddington&#x27;s equation relating the masses of a proton and an electron. He feared that this confirmation of Eddington&#x27;s theory, which he held to be absurd, might gain acceptance for it. His anxiety proved unjustified. Though a few years later I could note that a quite different set of new measurements had recently improved thirtyfold the accuracy of another prediction of Eddington&#x27;s theory, this too was disregarded as fortuitous by the great majority of physicists, The theory has since passed into limbo - from which no conceivable future confirma- tion can retrieve it. In refusing to take notice of the fact that some of Velikovsky &#x27;B pi\u00b7edictions came true, scientists acted on the same lines as they did, and did rightly, in respect of Eddington&#x27;s theories and in many other similar instances. This does not mean of course that scientists were always right in such actions. ! 1 have shown how they changed their opinion twice within a few years on the significance of the same kind of experimental evidence, I have myself suffered from the mistake of such judgments. In the same month when The Ame~tcag Behavioral Scientist came out protesting against the treatment of Velikovsky at the hand of scientific opinion, I published in Science an account of the way a theory that I had put forward almost half a century earlier on the adsorption of gases on solid surfaces was disregarded by science for much of that period, because its presuppositions were contrary to the current views about the nature of intermolecular forces. I recalled how the striking evidence I had produced for the theory was shrugged aside, while flimsy observations, which have since been recognised to be misleading, were given a central position in contradicting my views, Yet after a while it turned out that my theory was right. Still, I did not complain about this mistaken exercj s&quot;&gt; 01\u00b7 authority. Hard cases make bad laws, The kind of discipline, which had gone wrong in this case, was indispensable. Journals are bom- barded with contributions offering fundamental discoveries in physics, chemistry, biology or medicine, most of which are nonsensical. Sciencl cannot survive unless it can keep out such contributions and safe- guard the basic soundness of its publications. This may lead to the neglect or even supression of valuable contributions; but I think this risk is unavoidabl~. If it turned out that scientific discipline is keeping out a large number of important ideas 1 a relaxation of its severity might be indicated. But, if this led to the intrusion of a great many bogus contributions, the situation might become desperate. * Yet we may well wonder how the continuity enforced by current judgments of plausibility cari allow the appearance of any true originality, It certainly does allow it: Science presents a panorama of surprising developments. How can such surprises be produced on effectively dogmatic grounds? A phrase often heard in science may point towards the ex- planation. We often hear of surprising confirmations of a theory. The discovery of America by Columbus was a surprising confirmation of the earth&#x27;s sphericity; the discovery of electron diffraction was a surprising confirmation of de Broglie&#x27;s wave-theory of matter; the discoveries of genetics brought surprising confirmations of the Mendelian principles of heredity. We have here the paradigm of all progress in science: discoveries are made by pursuing unsuspected possibilities suggested by existing knowledge. This is how science retains its identity through a sequence of successive revolutions. The sight of a solid object before me indicates that it has another side and a hidden interior, which I could explore, and the sight of another person indicates unlimited hidden workings of his mind and body. Perception has this inexhaustible profundity because what we perceive is an aspect of reality and aspects of reality are clues to yet boundless undisclosed and perhaps yet unthinkable ex- periences. This is what the existing body of scientific thought is to the productive scientist: he sees in it an aspect of reality which as such is an inexhaustible source to new and promising prob- lems. And his work bears this out. Science continues to be fruitful, because it offers an insight into the nature of reality. This view of science recognises once more what all scientists actually believ~. For they must believe that science offer- us an aspect of reality, attd may therefore manifest its truth inex- haustibly and often surprisingly in ths future. Only in this belief, can the scientist conceive problems, pursue enquiries, claim dis- coveries; this belief is the ground on which he teaches his students and exercises his authority over the public. And it is by trans- mitting this belief to succeeding generations that scientists grant their pupils independent grounds from which to start towards their own discoveries and innovations, possibly in opposition to their own teachers. This belief both justifies the discipline of scientific soundness and safeguards the freedom of scientific originality. However, this can w:&gt;rk only so long as scientists have similar conceptions of the nature of things, What if a substantial difference arises about the nature of reality? If such basic dif- ferences arise, we must expect it to result in a scism. And indeed, reasoned discussion breaks down in science between two opinions based on different foundations. Neither side can produce then an argument which the other cannot interpret in his own tenns. I have described this some years ago for a number of important scientific polemics. A famous case was the violent controversy over the question whether fermentation is caused by living germ cells or by inanimate catalysts. It went on for more than half a century, involving such great chemists as Woehler and Liebig on the side of inanimate catalysts and including Pasteur on the side of living germ cells. Effective argument being impossible, it was sometimes supplemented by ridiculing the opponent&#x27;s views and pouring scorn on them. The controversy was resolved only after the contestants had died, by the discovery of enzymes which are the inanimate products of living cells. In a way both sides proved right. But I can see no guarantee that such a happy resolution of a conflict will always be po$sible and arrive in time for avoiding a fatal break in the rational procedure of scientific argument, And this brings us back to the origins of the Velikovsky case. Basic assumptions about the nature of things will tend to lie more widely apart between people inside and outside of science than they ever can be between scientists. Laymen normally accept the teachings of science not because they share its conception of reality, but because they submit to the authority of science. Hence if they ever venture seriously to dissent from scientific opinion, a regular argument may not prove feasible. And it will almost certainly prove impracticable when the question at issue is whether a certain set of evidence is to be taken seriously or not. There may be nothing strange to the layman in the suggestion that the average periods of ,.__, pregnancy of various animals are integer multiples of the number\u00b7i/, but he will only drive the scientist to despair if he challenges him to prove that this is absurd. He may feel affronted by the scientist&#x27;s undemonstrable judg)]lent which rejects at a glance a set of data that seem convincing to himself as a layman. He will demand that the evidence should at least be properly examined and cannot understt&#x27;lnd why the scientist, who prides himself on welcoming any novel idea with an open mind and on holding his own scientific theories only tentatively, sharply refuses his request. This is how Velikovsky 1 s ideas and facts, as other theories that are attractive to wide ranges of the public, evoked only angry rejection from scientists. Such conflicts between science and the general public may imperil science. It is generall:,&#x27;-SUIJJ)osed that science will always be protected from destructive lay interference on account of its economic benefits; but thi~_is. not so. The Soviet government adoptec the theories of Lysenko and gravely hampered all branches of biologi- cal research for_thirty years, overlooking altogether the damage to its agriculture. The ruling Party believed in fact that it was im- proving the cultivation of grain by Lysenko&#x27;s use of the hereditary transmission of acquired characters, which scientific genetics de- clared impossible. Far from preventing the attack on science, the economic motive greatly reinforced it - and this may frequently be the case. To defend science against lay rebellions on the grounds of its technical achievements may be very precarious. To pretend that science is open minded/that it is certainly not, may prove equally perilous. On the other hand, to declare that the purpose of science is to understand nature may seem dull and old fashioned, and to con- fess how greatly such explanation of nature relies on vague and un- demonstrable conceptions of reality, may sound positively scandalous. \\ But since this is in fact true, it might eventually prove safest to say so. In any case, it is only on these grounds that the rules governing scientific life can be understood. They alone can explain how an immense number of independent scientists, largely unknown to each other, co-operate step by step sharing the same undefinable assumptions and submitting to the same severe unwritten standards, Let me show how this works; For a scientific community, comprising large numbers, to exist, there must be a large area of hidden and yet accessible truths, far exceeding the capacity of one man to fathom, There must be work for thousands. Each starts then with sertsing a point of deepening coherence and continues by feeling his way towards that coherence. His questing imagination, guided by intuition, forces its way, until he has achieved success or admitted failure. The clues supporting his surmises are largely unspecifiable, his feeling of their poten- tialities hardly definable. Scientific research is one continued act of tacit integration - like making out an obscure sight, or being engaged in painting a picture, or in wr-iting a poem. It is rare therefore for two scientists to contribute to one enquiry on equal terms or for one scientist to be engaged in more than one problem at a time. But it is not rare for two or more scientists to make in- dependently the same discovery, for different scientists can actualise only the same available potentialities. We have here the reason why theinititiative to scientific enquiry, and its pursuit, must be left to the free decision of the individual scientist, and why it is effective. The scientist must be granted independence, because only his personal vision can achieve essential progress in science. Enquiries can be conducted as surveys according to plan, but they will never add up to a major new idea.</p>\n<p>\\ Independence will safeguard originality which is the essence of progress in science; but there is another requirement which has to be sustained by the authority of scientific opinion over scientists. To form ~art of science a statement of fact must not only be true, but also be interesting, and, more particularly, be interesting to science. Reliability, exactitude, counts as one of the factors, contributing to scientific interest, but it is not enough, Two further important factors enter into the assessment of scientific value. One is the w~y a new fact enters into the systematic structure of science, Corredting or expanding this structure. The other factor is independent both of the reliability and systematic interest of a scientific discovery for it lies in its subject matter 1 as known be- fore it was taken up by science: it consists in the intrinsic pre- scientific interest of the matter, studied by science. The scientific interest - or the scientific value - of a contribution to science is thus jointly formed by these three factors, which we may name as its exactitude, its systematic importance and the intrinsic interest of its subject matter. The proportion in which these factors enter into scientific value varies greatly over the various domains of science; deficiency in one factor may be balanced by greater excellence in another. The highest degree of exactitude and widest range of systematisation are found in mathematical physics, and this compensates here for a lesser intrinsic interest of its inanimate subject. At the other end of the sciences, we have domains like zoology and botany which lack exactitude and have no systematic structure comparable in range to that of physics, but which make up for this deficiency by the far greater intrinsic interest of living things compared with inanimate matter. A scientist engaged in research must have a keen sense of scientific value, he must be attracted by problems promising a result having such value, must be capable of feeling his way towards it and of realising the value of an important result when he has found it. Failure to recognise the importance of one&#x27;s result will delay its publication, hamper its development and presentation. Failure to abandon a line of enquiry which can bring only unimportant results is part of the same weakness. Anyone who has conducted a research school will know of such heavily damaging and mortifying mistakes. They do indeed mark a serious deficiency in one&#x27;s scien- tific ability, The assessment of scientific value is also the principal standard by which the social structure of the scientific community is determined. Funds and appointments serving scientific research must be distributed in a way that promises the highest total in- crement to science. Authority at influential centers must be given to scientists distinguished by their exceptional capacity for ad- vancing science and rewards be distributed so as to encourage the greatest total advancement of science. Every decision of this kind requires comparisons of scientific value. It can be made in ,\u00b7a-t,ion&quot; l. way only if there exist true standards for comparing the value of contributions to science all along the range of sciences from astro- nomy to medicine. This does not mean that one has to compare the scientific value of one entire branch of science with another, say astronomy with medicine. It requires only that we be able to compare the scientific increment achieved at similar costs of effort and money in the various branches of science and among rivals within those branches. The marginal principle of economics offers the conceptual model for this. It tells us that the marginal yield in terms of scientific value must be kept equal all along the advancing borders of the sciences, But how can anybody ccmpare the scientific value of disco- veries in astronomy with those in medicine? Nobody can, but nobody (/&#x27; need to do,. All that is required is that we compare these values in closely neighbouring fields of science. Judgpients extending over neighbourhoods will overlap and form a chain spahning the entire range of sciences. This principle, the principle of overlapping neighbourhoods, fulfils here the functions which a capital market performs in comparing the profitability of competing enterprises through the thousand branches of an economic system. We must ask now how the two great principles which underly the growth of science, can effectively control the joint enterprise of the scientific community. How can the initiatives of scientists independently chosing their problems be co-ordinated? And how can they be subjected to scientific rigour, how be guided by true scientific value and have their merits rightly assessed and rewarded? These aims will be achieved by two twin principles: namely, self- coordination by mutual adjustment and discipline under mutual autho- rity. Of self-coordination by mutual adjustment I have written often in the past fifteen years. Each scientist sets himself a problem and pursues it with a view to the results achieved before by all other scientists, who had likewise set themselves problems and pursued them with a view to the results achieved by others before. Such self-coordination represents the highest possible efficiency in the use of scientific talent and material resources, provided only, that the professional opportunities for research and the money for its pursuit are rationally distributed. This brings us to the principle of mutual authority. It consists in the fact that scientists keep watdh over each other. Each scientist is both subject to criticism by all others and is encouraged by their appreciation, This is how scientific opinion is formed, which enforces scientific standards and regulates the dis- tribution of professional opportunities and research grants. Natu- rally, only fellow-scientists working in closely related fields are competent to exercise authority over each other; but their restricted fields form chains of overlapping neighbourhoods extending over the )~ entire range of sciences, Thus an indirect consensus is formed between scientists so far apart that they could not understand more than a tiny fraction of each other&#x27;s subjects. It suffices that the standards of plausibility and worthwhileness be equal around ever single point; this will keep them equal over all the sciences, Hence scientists from the most distant branches of science will rely on each other&#x27;s results and will support each other against any laymen seriously challenging their scientific authority. * ---- - ,:, Mutual authority, based on overlapping competences will apply also to other cultural fields and indeed to a wide range of consensual activities of which the participants know only a small fragment, It suggests a way by which resources can be rationally distributed bet- ween any rival purposes that cannot be valued in terms of money. All cases of public expenditure serving collective interests are of this kind. This is, I believe, how the claims of a thousand government departments can be fairly rationally adjudicated, though no single person can know well more than a tiny fraction of them. Such is the constitution of the scientific community. It is governed by beliefs, by values and practices transmitted to succeeding generations. Each new independent member adheres to this tradition, while assuming at the same time the responsibility shared by all members for re-interpreting the tradition and possibly revo- lutionising its teachings. The opportunities for discovery offered by nature to the human mind are not of our making. We have developed a body of thought capable of exploiting these opportunities and have organised a body of men for this task. The laws of this community are determined by the nature of its task. But the task itself is indeterminate: it merely demands that we advance into the unknown. And even after this is done, the advances are not known to any single man, for no man can know more than a tiny fragment of science. Thus the opportunities offered by nature to the human mind, have evoked in our society a response over which we have no control. This is what I meant by speaking in my title of the growth of science in society. Maybe we should rejoice to be servants of such great transcendent powers. Maybe we are becoming, and even ought to become, in other ways too a Society of Explorers dedicated to the pursuit of aims unknown to us. Perhaps the freedom of thought in which we take pride, has such awsome implications. I cannot tell.</p>",
    "content_text": ", 1)-\nl' \n- ' \n'' \nLecture 4 \nThe Growth of Science in Society \nby Michael Polanyi \n(Delivered at Wesleyan University; October 28, 1965) \nThe purpose of my lecture today is two-pronged. \nI want to \noutline the way scientific research is organised, and must be organised \nAnd for this purpose I shall have to speak again of the grounds on \nwhi_ch science rests and the way in which discoveries are made. \nI shall use as my starting point a notorious conflict bet-\nween the scientific world and a considerable part of the lay public. \nI shall tell you how this controversy has recently led a distinguished \ngroup of sociologists to pronounce a wholesale condemnation of scien-\ntific procedures and I shall try then to resolve this situation by \napplying my own views on the nature of scientific discovery. \nThis \nshall lead us then to a general theory of scientific life: of dis-\ncipline and freedom in scientific institutions, \nThe current situation in the philosophy of science is a \nstrange one, \nThe movement of logical positivism, which aimed at a \nstrict definition of validity and meaning, reached the height of its \nclaims and prestige about twenty years ago. \nSince then it has become \nclearer year by year that this aim was unattainable. \nBut since (to \nmy knowledge) no alternative has been offered to the desired strict \ncriteria of scientific truth, we have no accepted theory of scientific \nknowledge today. \nMost writers on science have accepted science as an un-\nquestionable fact which is not in need of philosophic justification \nnor capable of justification. - You will rarely find this spelled out, \nbut it is confirmed by current practice. \nTake a widely accepted \naccount of science in Ernest Nagel's Structure of Science (1961), \nHe writes that we do not know, whether the premisses assumed in the \nexplanation of the sciences are true; \nand were the requirement that \nthey be known to be true adopted, most of the widely accepted expla-\nnations in current science would have to be rejected as unsatisfactory. \nIn other words, we must save our belief in the truth of scientific \nexplanations by refraining to ask what they are based upon. \nScien-\ntific truth is defined then as that which scientists say or think to \nbe true. \nYet this lack of philosophic justification has not damaged \nthe public authority of science, but rather increased it. Modern \nphilosophers have played down this shortcoming, by declaring that \nthe claims of science are only tentative and ever open to refutation \nby adverse evidence. \nAnd this added to the authority of science. It \nwas taken to show that, while scientific knowledge was supremely re-\nliable, scientists were at the same time supremely open-minded, \nsetting an example of incomparable modesty and tolerance, \nYet there have been some occasions in this century when \nthe very foundations of science have been challenged. \nSporadic \nattacks came in the form of laws against teaching the theory of \nevolution and in a papal encyclical warning against this theory. \nAn \nattack on a broad front was made by the Soviet Union. \nBut a more \nrecent and personal challenge to the foundations of science came from \nDr. Velikovsky's highly unorthodox book Worlds in Collision published \nabout fifteen years ago. \nThough emphatically rejected by scientists, \nit had a wide response among the lay public, who much resented the \nsummary dismissal of the book by the experts. \nThen, some three years \nago, new evidence turned up supporting Velikovsky's theory, but this \nwas again bluntly rejected by scientists. \nThis seemed utterly \nunjustified to many people and a group of sociologists took up the \nmatter. \nThey launched a systematic attack in the American Behavioral \nScientist under the leadership of its Editor, Professor de Grazia, on \nthe whole procedure by which contributions to science are tested, \naccepted or rejected. \nA few words may cover for my present purpose Velikovsky's \ntheory, since its truth or falsity will not be at issue. \nHis theory \nis based on the acceptance of evidence from the Old Testament, the \nHindu Vedas and Greek Roman mythology about the occurrence of cata-\nstrophic events in the earth1s history from the fifteenth to the \nseventh century B.C. \nIt interprets these disasters and upheavals \nas due to the repeated passage of the earth through the tail of a \ncomet. \nThis comet he claims, subsequently collided with Mars and by \nlosing its tail transformed its head into the planet Venus. \nFurther \nterrestrial upheavals ensued when in the year 687 B,C. Mars nearly \ncollided with the earth; \non one occasion the earth turned completely \nover, so that the sun rose in the west and set in the east. \nTo account \nfor these events Velikovsky supplements \nNewtonian gravitation by the \nassumption of powerful electrical and magnetic fields acting between \nplanets. \nAs I said before, these ideas were rejected by astronomers, \nbut appealed to a wide circle of laymen: \nthe book became actually \na best seller. \nAnd so bitter was the reaction of astronomers and \nother scientists to this, and the pressure they exercised, such that \nMacMillan's who had publiehed v~likovsky's book, felt compelled to \ngive up their rights in it and passed them on to Doubleday's who felt \nless vulnerable by the hostility of scientific opinion. \nWhen eventually in September 1963 the American Behavioral \nScientist published its protest against the tre~tment of Velikovsky, \nthe editor, Alfred de Grazia, Professor of Government in New York \nUniversity, stated the aim of the enquiry to be undertaken as follows: \n\"The central problems are clear: \nWho determines scientific truth? \nWhat is their warrant?\" and he adds that \"some judg\u00b5ient must be \npassed upon the behavior of scientists and, if adverse, some remedies \nmust be proposed,\" \nReferring to the three articles in this issue of his journal \nde Grazia went on to say that! \n11if the judgment of the authors is \ncorrect, the scientific establishment is gravely inadequate to its \nprofessed aims, commits ihjustices as~ matter of course, and is \nbadly in need of research and reform.\" \nIf we accepted the positivist critique of science which \nleaves us today no other ultimate criterion of a scientific teaching, \nas that scientists accept it as valid, the answer to de Grazia's \nfirst question, Who determines scientific truth? would be: \n\"The \nscientists.\" \nAnd to the second question, What is their warrant? we \nwould answer that the decisions of scientists cannot be accounted for. \nBut this is not satisfactory. \nWe must be able to ask whethe. \nthe reception of Velikovsky's ideas by scientists was fair, and, if \nnot, what went wrong? \nProfessor de Grazia sets out five points of \na rational procedure for testing a proposed contribution to science. \nFirst, a contribution must not be rejected unread; \nsecond, it may \nclaim to be tested and publicly discussed with its author; \nif it \nsuggests radical innovations, this should be welcomed fourth, if its \nideas were at first rejected, they should have a chance to return with \nadditional proof and once more be cordially examined; and fifth, \nshould \nno authority/prevail against experimental evidence. \nProfessor de Grazia shows that all these rules were broken \nin Velikovsky's treatment by scientists. \nHis work was condemned as \nutter nonsense by distinguished astronomers who frankly said they \nhad not read his book. \nHe asked to be admitted to a public discussion \nof his views and this was refused. \nHe had concluded that the surface \nof Venus was hot and its atmosphere heavy with hydrocarbons, \nHe \nasked the Harvard Observatory to test this prediction and this was \nrefused. \nThis happened in 1946; \nin February 1963 the American space \nexplorer, Mariner II, confirmed Velikovsky's predictions about Venus: \nits surface temperature was 800\u00b0 F. and its clouds replete with \nhydrocarbons. \nBut this striking success of the theory did not succeed \nin causing its discussion to be reopened by scientists; it was rated \nas a curious coincidence, \nAuthority prevailed against facts. \nI think it is understandable that Professor de Grazia was \ndisappointed by the failure of scientists to live up to their pro-\nfessions of giving a ready hearing to any new ideas and submitting \nhumbly to the test of any evidence contradicting their current views. \nNo wonder perhaps that he went on then to affirm that the acceptance \nof new contributions by science does in fact not depend on the eviden-\nce of its truth, but takes place either at random, or in the service \nof ruling powers, or responding to economic or political interests, \nor simply as dictated by accepted dogma, \nHe was certainly right in \ncontrasting the principles which scientists profess to follow in \ndealing with a novel contribution to science, with the way they \nactually treated Velikovsky's ideas. \nBut the situation changes if these principles are qualified \nby their tacit assumptions, \nThis is what I propose to do now; \nand \nonce done, this should resolve also the dilemma produced by the modern \nphilosophic critique of science. It will show that this critique \nleads to absurd results because in its search for strictly definable \ncriteria of scientific truth it necessarily overlooks the tacit \nprinciples on which science is actually founded. \nA vital judgment practiced in science which is manifestly \ninformal, is the assessment of plausibility, \nOnly plausible ideas \nare taken up, discussed and tested by scientists. \nSuch a decision \nmay later be proved right, but at the time that it is made, the \nassessment of plausibility is based on a broad exercise of intuition \nguided by many subtle indications, and is thus manifestly undemonstr-\nable. \nTo show what I mean I shall recall an example of a claim \nlacking plausibility to the point of being absurd, which I picked \nup twenty five years ago in a letter published in Nature, \nThe author \nof this letter had observed that the average gestation period of \ndifferent animals ranging from rabbits to cows was an integer multiple \n,~=-' \nof the number // \nThe evidence he produced was ample, the agreement \ngood, \nYet the acceptance of this contribution by the journal was only \nmeant as a joke, \nNo amount of evidence could convince a modern \n,.---, \nbiologist that gestation periods are equal to integer multiples of II \u2022 \nOur conception of the nature of things tells us that such a relation-\nship is absurd. \nA more technical example from physics can be found \nin a paper by Lord Raleigh published in the Proceedings of the Royal \nSociety in 1947, \nIt described some fairly simple experiments which \nproved in the author's opinion that a hydrogen atom impinging on a \nmetal wire could transmit to it energies ranging to a hundred electron-\nvolts, \nSuch an observation, if correct, would be far more revolu-\ntionary than the discovery of atomic fission by Otto Hahn in 1939, \nYet when this paper appeared and I asked various physicists' opinions \nabout it, they only shrugged their shoulders. \nThey could not find \nfault with the experiment, yet they not only did not believe its \nresults, but not even thought it worthwhile to consider what was \nwrong with it, let alone check upon it. \nThey just ignored it. About \nten years later some experiments were brought to my notice which \nI \naccidentally offered an explanation of Lord Raleigh's findings. \nHis results were apparently due to some hidden factors of no great \ninterest, but which he could hardly have identified at the time. \nHe \nshould have ignored his observation, as his colleagues were quite \nrightly to do. \nIn my early writings I have also described how the possible \nreality of a certain type of observations which had long been denied, \nwas for a time accepted, then again rejected, only to be soon accepted \nagain and presently rejected once more, these two consecutive alter-\nnations of acceptance and rejection taking place within 25 years. \nThe observations in question were the apparent transformations of \nelements. \nEver since the immutability of elements had been accepted, \nsuch observations have been cast aside as dirt effects, but after \nRutherford and Soddy established the fact of radioactive disintegra-\ntion, they were taken seriously and accepted for publication, but \ndisappeared from journals again, as it was recognised that radio-\nactivity occurs only in very few comparatively rare elements. \nNew \nreports of apparently well authenticated cases appeared in journals \nonce more in response to Rutherford's discovery of artificial dis-\nintegration of elements, and these presently vanished again as the \nnature of such disintegration became clear and showed that it could \nnot happen in a chemical laboratory. \nThese apparent chemical trans-\nformations of elements must again continue to turn up, but are un~ \nhesitatingly ignored once more as they had been all along until the \nadvent of radioactivity. \nSuppose then that Velikovsky's claims were as unplausible \n.,,--\nas the parallelism between periods of gestation and the number if ; \nor as unplausible as Lord Raleigh's results published in the Pro-\nceedings of the Royal Society; \norj again, as unplausible as the \nchemical transformation of elements appears to be now - or if it were \nto appear even more absurd than these possibilities do - then it would \ncertainly correspond to the current custom of science to reject them \nat a glance unread, and to refuse discussing them publicly with the \nauthor. \nIndeed, to drop one's work in order to test some of the \nclaims of Velikovsky as requested by him, would appear a culpable \nwaste of time, of expense and of effort. \nBut how about the predictions of Velikovsky which came true? \nShould these not have caused his book to be reconsidered? \nNo, a \ntheory rejected as absurd will not always be made plausible by the \nconfirmation of some of its predictions. \nThe fate of Eddington's \ncosmic theories may illustrate this. \nFar back in 1946 I put on re-\ncord an anxious remark by a dinstinguished mathematician, (then pro-\nfessor at the University of Manchester), who complained that recent \nmeasurements had much strengthened the evidence for Eddington's \nequation relating the masses of a proton and an electron. \nHe feared \nthat this confirmation of Eddington's theory, which he held to be \nabsurd, might gain acceptance for it. His anxiety proved unjustified. \nThough a few years later I could note that a quite different set of \nnew measurements had recently improved thirtyfold the accuracy of \nanother prediction of Eddington's theory, this too was disregarded \nas fortuitous by the great majority of physicists, \nThe theory has \nsince passed into limbo - from which no conceivable future confirma-\ntion can retrieve it. \nIn refusing to take notice of the fact that \nsome of Velikovsky 'B pi\u00b7edictions came true, scientists acted on the \nsame lines as they did, and did rightly, in respect of Eddington's \ntheories and in many other similar instances. \nThis does not mean of course that scientists were always \nright in such actions. \n! \n1 have shown how they changed their opinion \ntwice within a \nfew years on the significance of the same kind of \nexperimental evidence, \nI have myself suffered from the mistake of \nsuch judgments. \nIn the same month when The Ame~tcag Behavioral \nScientist came out protesting against the treatment of Velikovsky \nat the hand of scientific opinion, I published in Science an account \nof the way a theory that I had put forward almost half a century \nearlier on the adsorption of gases on solid surfaces was disregarded \nby science for much of that period, because its presuppositions were \ncontrary to the current views about the nature of intermolecular \nforces. \nI recalled how the striking evidence I had produced for the \ntheory was shrugged aside, while flimsy observations, which have \nsince been recognised to be misleading, were given a central position \nin contradicting my views, \nYet after a while it turned out that my \ntheory was right. \nStill, I did not complain about this mistaken exercj s\"> 01\u00b7 \nauthority. \nHard cases make bad laws, \nThe kind of discipline, which \nhad gone wrong in this case, was indispensable. \nJournals are bom-\nbarded with contributions offering fundamental discoveries in physics, \nchemistry, biology or medicine, most of which are nonsensical. \nSciencl \ncannot survive unless it can keep out such contributions and safe-\nguard the basic soundness of its publications. \nThis may lead to the \nneglect or even supression of valuable contributions; but I think \nthis risk is unavoidabl~. \nIf it turned out that scientific discipline \nis keeping out a large number of important ideas 1 a relaxation of its \nseverity might be indicated. \nBut, if this led to the intrusion of a \ngreat many bogus contributions, the situation might become desperate. \n* \nYet we may well wonder how the continuity enforced by \ncurrent judgments of plausibility cari allow the appearance of any \ntrue originality, It certainly does allow it: Science presents a \npanorama of surprising developments. \nHow can such surprises be \nproduced on effectively dogmatic grounds? \nA phrase often heard in science may point towards the ex-\nplanation. \nWe often hear of surprising confirmations of a theory. \nThe discovery of America by Columbus was a surprising confirmation \nof the earth's sphericity; the discovery of electron diffraction was \na surprising confirmation of de Broglie's wave-theory of matter; \nthe \ndiscoveries of genetics brought surprising confirmations of the \nMendelian principles of heredity. \nWe have here the paradigm of all \nprogress in science: \ndiscoveries are made by pursuing unsuspected \npossibilities suggested by existing knowledge. \nThis is how science \nretains its identity through a sequence of successive revolutions. \nThe sight of a solid object before me indicates that it has \nanother side and a hidden interior, which I could explore, and the \nsight of another person indicates unlimited hidden workings of his \nmind and body. \nPerception has this inexhaustible profundity because \nwhat we perceive is an aspect of reality and aspects of reality are \nclues to yet boundless undisclosed and perhaps yet unthinkable ex-\nperiences. \nThis is what the existing body of scientific thought is \nto the productive scientist: \nhe sees in it an aspect of reality \nwhich as such is an inexhaustible source to new and promising prob-\nlems. \nAnd his work bears this out. \nScience continues to be fruitful, \nbecause it offers an insight into the nature of reality. \nThis view of science recognises once more what all \nscientists actually believ~. \nFor they must believe that science offer-\nus an aspect of reality, attd may therefore manifest its truth inex-\nhaustibly and often surprisingly in ths future. \nOnly in this belief, \ncan the scientist conceive problems, pursue enquiries, claim dis-\ncoveries; this belief is the ground on which he teaches his students \nand exercises his authority over the public. \nAnd it is by trans-\nmitting this belief to succeeding generations that scientists grant \ntheir pupils independent grounds from which to start towards their \nown discoveries and innovations, possibly in opposition to their own \nteachers. \nThis belief both justifies the discipline of scientific \nsoundness and safeguards the freedom of scientific originality. \nHowever, this can w:>rk only so long as scientists have \nsimilar conceptions of the nature of things, \nWhat if a substantial \ndifference arises about the nature of reality? If such basic dif-\nferences arise, we must expect it to result in a scism. \nAnd indeed, \nreasoned discussion breaks down in science between two opinions based \non different foundations. \nNeither side can produce then an argument \nwhich the other cannot interpret in his own tenns. \nI have described \nthis some years ago for a number of important scientific polemics. \nA famous case was the violent controversy over the question whether \nfermentation is caused by living germ cells or by inanimate catalysts. \nIt went on for more than half a century, involving such great chemists \nas Woehler and Liebig on the side of inanimate catalysts and including \nPasteur on the side of living germ cells. Effective argument being \nimpossible, it was sometimes supplemented by ridiculing the opponent's \nviews and pouring scorn on them. \nThe controversy was resolved only \nafter the contestants had died, by the discovery of enzymes which are \nthe inanimate products of living cells. \nIn a way both sides proved \nright. \nBut I can see no guarantee that such a happy resolution of \na conflict will always be po$sible and arrive in time for avoiding \na fatal break in the rational procedure of scientific argument, \nAnd this brings us back to the origins of the Velikovsky \ncase. \nBasic assumptions about the nature of things will tend to lie \nmore widely apart between people inside and outside of science than \nthey ever can be between scientists. \nLaymen normally accept the \nteachings of science not because they share its conception of reality, \nbut because they submit to the authority of science. \nHence if they \never venture seriously to dissent from scientific opinion, a regular \nargument may not prove feasible. \nAnd it will almost certainly prove \nimpracticable when the question at issue is whether a certain set \nof evidence is to be taken seriously or not. \nThere may be nothing \nstrange to the layman in the suggestion that the average periods of \n,.__, \npregnancy of various animals are integer multiples of the number\u00b7i/, \nbut he will only drive the scientist to despair if he challenges \nhim to prove that this is absurd. \nHe may feel affronted by the \nscientist's undemonstrable judg)]lent which rejects at a glance a set \nof data that seem convincing to himself as a layman. \nHe will demand \nthat the evidence should at least be properly examined and cannot \nunderstt'lnd why the scientist, who prides himself on welcoming any \nnovel idea with an open mind and on holding his own scientific \ntheories only tentatively, sharply refuses his request. \nThis is how \nVelikovsky 1 s ideas and facts, as other theories that are attractive \nto wide ranges of the public, evoked only angry rejection from \nscientists. \nSuch conflicts between science and the general public may \nimperil science. \nIt is generall:,'-SUIJJ)osed that science will always \nbe protected from destructive lay interference on account of its \neconomic benefits; \nbut thi~_is. not so. \nThe Soviet government adoptec \nthe theories of Lysenko and gravely hampered all branches of biologi-\ncal research for_thirty years, overlooking altogether the damage to \nits agriculture. \nThe ruling Party believed in fact that it was im-\nproving the cultivation of grain by Lysenko's use of the hereditary \ntransmission of acquired characters, which scientific genetics de-\nclared impossible. \nFar from preventing the attack on science, the \neconomic motive greatly reinforced it - and this may frequently be \nthe case. \nTo defend science against lay rebellions on the grounds of \nits technical achievements may be very precarious. \nTo pretend that \nscience is open minded/that it is certainly not, may prove equally \nperilous. \nOn the other hand, to declare that the purpose of science \nis to understand nature may seem dull and old fashioned, and to con-\nfess how greatly such explanation of nature relies on vague and un-\ndemonstrable conceptions of reality, may sound positively scandalous. \n\\ \nBut since this is in fact true, it might eventually prove safest to \nsay so. \nIn any case, it is only on these grounds that the rules \ngoverning scientific life can be understood. \nThey alone can explain \nhow an immense number of independent scientists, largely unknown to \neach other, co-operate step by step sharing the same undefinable \nassumptions and submitting to the same severe unwritten standards, \nLet me show how this works; \nFor a scientific community, comprising large numbers, to \nexist, there must be a large area of hidden and yet accessible truths, \nfar exceeding the capacity of one man to fathom, \nThere must be work \nfor thousands. \nEach starts then with sertsing a point of deepening \ncoherence and continues by feeling his way towards that coherence. \nHis questing imagination, guided by intuition, forces its way, until \nhe has achieved success or admitted failure. \nThe clues supporting \nhis surmises are largely unspecifiable, his feeling of their poten-\ntialities hardly definable. Scientific research is one continued \nact of tacit integration - like making out an obscure sight, or being \nengaged in painting a picture, or in wr-iting a poem. \nIt is rare \ntherefore for two scientists to contribute to one enquiry on equal \nterms or for one scientist to be engaged in more than one problem at \na time. \nBut it is not rare for two or more scientists to make in-\ndependently the same discovery, for different scientists can actualise \nonly the same available potentialities. \nWe have here the reason why theinititiative to scientific \nenquiry, and its pursuit, must be left to the free decision of the \nindividual scientist, and why it is effective. \nThe scientist must \nbe granted independence, because only his personal vision can achieve \nessential progress in science. \nEnquiries can be conducted as surveys \naccording to plan, but they will never add up to a major new idea. \n\n\\ \nIndependence will safeguard originality which is the \nessence of progress in science; \nbut there is another requirement \nwhich has to be sustained by the authority of scientific opinion over \nscientists. \nTo form ~art of science a statement of fact must not \nonly be true, but also be interesting, and, more particularly, be \ninteresting to science. Reliability, exactitude, counts as one of \nthe factors, contributing to scientific interest, but it is not enough, \nTwo further important factors enter into the assessment of scientific \nvalue. \nOne is the w~y a new fact enters into the systematic structure \nof science, Corredting or expanding this structure. \nThe other factor \nis independent both of the reliability and systematic interest of a \nscientific discovery for it lies in its subject matter 1 as known be-\nfore it was taken up by science: it consists in the intrinsic pre-\nscientific interest of the matter, studied by science. \nThe scientific interest - or the scientific value - of a \ncontribution to science is thus jointly formed by these three factors, \nwhich we may name as its exactitude, its systematic importance and \nthe intrinsic interest of its subject matter. \nThe proportion in which \nthese factors enter into scientific value varies greatly over the \nvarious domains of science; \ndeficiency in one factor may be balanced \nby greater excellence in another. \nThe highest degree of exactitude \nand widest range of systematisation are found in mathematical physics, \nand this compensates here for a lesser intrinsic interest of its \ninanimate subject. \nAt the other end of the sciences, we have domains \nlike zoology and botany which lack exactitude and have no systematic \nstructure comparable in range to that of physics, but which make up \nfor this deficiency by the far greater intrinsic interest of living \nthings compared with inanimate matter. \nA scientist engaged in research must have a keen sense of \nscientific value, he must be attracted by problems promising a \nresult having such value, must be capable of feeling his way towards \nit and of realising the value of an important result when he has \nfound it. Failure to recognise the importance of one's result will \ndelay its publication, hamper its development and presentation. \nFailure to abandon a line of enquiry which can bring only unimportant \nresults is part of the same weakness. \nAnyone who has conducted a \nresearch school will know of such heavily damaging and mortifying \nmistakes. \nThey do indeed mark a serious deficiency in one's scien-\ntific ability, \nThe assessment of scientific value is also the principal \nstandard by which the social structure of the scientific community \nis determined. \nFunds and appointments serving scientific research \nmust be distributed in a way that promises the highest total in-\ncrement to science. \nAuthority at influential centers must be given \nto scientists distinguished by their exceptional capacity for ad-\nvancing science and rewards be distributed so as to encourage the \ngreatest total advancement of science. \nEvery decision of this kind \nrequires comparisons of scientific value. It can be made in ,\u00b7a-t,ion\" l. \nway only if there exist true standards for comparing the value of \ncontributions to science all along the range of sciences from astro-\nnomy to medicine. \nThis does not mean that one has to compare the scientific \nvalue of one entire branch of science with another, say astronomy \nwith medicine. \nIt requires only that we be able to compare the \nscientific increment achieved at similar costs of effort and money \nin the various branches of science and among rivals within those \nbranches. \nThe marginal principle of economics offers the conceptual \nmodel for this. It tells us that the marginal yield in terms of \nscientific value must be kept equal all along the advancing borders \nof the sciences, \nBut how can anybody ccmpare the scientific value of disco-\nveries in astronomy with those in medicine? \nNobody can, but nobody \n(/' \nneed to do,. \nAll that is required is that we compare these values \nin closely neighbouring fields of science. Judgpients extending over \nneighbourhoods will overlap and form a chain spahning the entire \nrange of sciences. \nThis principle, the principle of overlapping \nneighbourhoods, fulfils here the functions which a capital market \nperforms in comparing the profitability of competing enterprises \nthrough the thousand branches of an economic system. \nWe must ask now how the two great principles which underly \nthe growth of science, can effectively control the joint enterprise \nof the scientific community. \nHow can the initiatives of scientists \nindependently chosing their problems be co-ordinated? \nAnd how can \nthey be subjected to scientific rigour, how be guided by true \nscientific value and have their merits rightly assessed and rewarded? \nThese aims will be achieved by two twin principles: \nnamely, self-\ncoordination by mutual adjustment and discipline under mutual autho-\nrity. \nOf self-coordination by mutual adjustment I have written \noften in the past fifteen years. \nEach scientist sets himself a \nproblem and pursues it with a view to the results achieved before \nby all other scientists, who had likewise set themselves problems \nand pursued them with a view to the results achieved by others before. \nSuch self-coordination represents the highest possible efficiency in \nthe use of scientific talent and material resources, provided only, \nthat the professional opportunities for research and the money for \nits pursuit are rationally distributed. \nThis brings us to the principle of mutual authority. It \nconsists in the fact that scientists keep watdh over each other. \nEach scientist is both subject to criticism by all others and is \nencouraged by their appreciation, \nThis is how scientific opinion \nis formed, which enforces scientific standards and regulates the dis-\ntribution of professional opportunities and research grants. \nNatu-\nrally, only fellow-scientists working in closely related fields are \ncompetent to exercise authority over each other; \nbut their restricted \nfields form chains of overlapping neighbourhoods extending over the \n)~ \nentire range of sciences, \nThus an indirect consensus is formed between scientists so \nfar apart that they could not understand more than a tiny fraction \nof each other's subjects. \nIt suffices that the standards of \nplausibility and worthwhileness be equal around ever single point; \nthis will keep them equal over all the sciences, \nHence scientists \nfrom the most distant branches of science will rely on each other's \nresults and will support each other against any laymen seriously \nchallenging their scientific authority. \n* \n----\n-\n,:, \nMutual authority, based on overlapping competences will apply \nalso to other cultural fields and indeed to a wide range of consensual \nactivities of which the participants know only a small fragment, It \nsuggests a way by which resources can be rationally distributed bet-\nween any rival purposes that cannot be valued in terms of money. \nAll \ncases of public expenditure serving collective interests are of this \nkind. \nThis is, I believe, how the claims of a thousand government \ndepartments can be fairly rationally adjudicated, though no single \nperson can know well more than a tiny fraction of them. \nSuch is the constitution of the scientific community. \nIt is governed by beliefs, by values and practices transmitted to \nsucceeding generations. \nEach new independent member adheres to this \ntradition, while assuming at the same time the responsibility shared \nby all members for re-interpreting the tradition and possibly revo-\nlutionising its teachings. \nThe opportunities for discovery offered by nature to the \nhuman mind are not of our making. \nWe have developed a body of thought \ncapable of exploiting these opportunities and have organised a body \nof men for this task. \nThe laws of this community are determined by \nthe nature of its task. \nBut the task itself is indeterminate: it \nmerely demands that we advance into the unknown. \nAnd even after this \nis done, the advances are not known to any single man, for no man can \nknow more than a tiny fragment of science. \nThus the opportunities offered by nature to the human mind, \nhave evoked in our society a response over which we have no control. \nThis is what I meant by speaking in my title of the growth of science \nin society. Maybe we should rejoice to be servants of such great \ntranscendent powers. \nMaybe we are becoming, and even ought to become, \nin other ways too a Society of Explorers dedicated to the pursuit of \naims unknown to us. \nPerhaps the freedom of thought in which we take \npride, has such awsome implications. \nI cannot tell.",

    "content_html": "<p>) Lecture 5 Levels of Realitv by Michael Polan1ri (Delivered at Wesleyan University, November 11, 1965) I have told you how Copernicus ousted man from his central position in the universe and destroyed the theological cosmos. The heavenly sphere of divine perfection towards which, from his fallen sublunar existence, man was bound to strive, was dissolved in a space without limits, without shape or centre. And monotony in space was extended into monotony in depth, by the atomic theory of matter. Galileo&#x27;s mechanics, amplified by Newton, gave new lffe to the theory that all things are ultimately composed of masses in motion. Atomic particles alone were real and all phenomena were merely appearances of this ultimate reality. Man himself was but a chance collocation of atoms, without purpose or meaning. I shall speak in my last lecture in February of the great historical benefits of this scientific world view. Battling for freedom of thought against established authority, it cleared the way for political freedom and humanitarian reforms. Scientific rationa- lism brought social and moral progress that has improved almost every human relationship in western civilization. It has been up to our own days, the chief guide towards intellectual, moral and social advances. But troubles developed and became serious in our own century. The demand that all things must be explained by the laws of physics and chemistry became more insistent and more destructive. Its inflexible pursuit has deprived our genuine convictions from all theoretical foundations. Our whole culture is harassed by self- doubt. I shall propose here a principle which would restore our acceptance of higher forms of being and show how we can know and do know these less tangible levels of existence. It will be left for my later lectures to outline the way such a change in our conception of reality might benefit us culturally and perhaps in public affairs. * The mechanical philosophy of Galileo was more fully stated by Laplace when defining a Universal Knowledge of the World. He pointed out that from to-day&#x27;s topography of the ultimate particles of the world (which would include their velocities and the forces acting between them) we could calculate any future topography of the same particles, and he claimed that this would give us a knowledge of all things to come, to the very end of time. It has been objected that such predictions contradict the exercise of free will, but this had only the effect of calling in question our possession of free wilJ. Indeed, to bring up this particular difficulty of free will is to overlook the more massive fact, that a Laplacean atomic topography would tell us virtually nothing that is of interest to us. It would give us the total energy of any particular region in the universe, but we could not even make out -as we shall see - whether things in that region had any definite temperature, and if so what that temperature was. To fathom the depth of such ignorance parading as Universal Knowledge, imagine yourself deprived of all your previous experience and presented in its place with a Laplacean topography of the univers6 Though you were endowed with an unlimited ability for mechanical computations, you would search in vain to calculate something worth knowing. For what you would want to know are things seen and felt, things heard and smelt, and the laws of mechanics cannot derive such knowledge from a topography of atomic particles, Alone the action of our sentient self, responding to the atoms impinging upon our senses, can supply such information. But even granting, for the sake of argument, our powers of sentience and forgetting also that an atomic topography cannot define temperature, we could still get no further than to derive the laws of physics and chemistry, and this would not enable us to re- cognise living and sentient beings. In saying this, I contradict the claims of biologists who affirm that they are explaining life in terms of physics and chemistry. But the fact is that they do nothing of the kind. The purpose which biology actually pursues, and by which it achieves its triumphs, consists predominantly in explaining the functions of living beings in terms of a mechanism founded on the laws of physics and chemistry, yet not.explicable by these laws, We can make this clear by showing that no mechanism, not even the simplest machine, can be explained in terms of physics and chemistry. Let me choose as an example of a machine the watch I wear on my wrist. My watch tells the time. It is kept going by the main-spring, incoiling under the control of the hair spring and balance wheel, and thus it turns the hands which tell the time, Such are the operational principles of a watch, the principles which define its construction and working. It is these principles that cannot be defined by the laws of inanimate nature. For no part of a watch is formed by the natural equilibration of matter. Each is artificially shaped and connected to perform its function, Physics and chemistry cannot reveal the practical principles embodied in a machine, any more than the physical chemical testing of a printed page can tell the content of its text. But how can we embody any structural or operational prin- ciple in a piece of inanimate matter, without interfering with the laws of inanimate matter? To answer this question, we must realise that no inanimate object is ever fully determined by the laws of physics and chemistry, Laplace himself had to assume for his specu- lations on future atomic topographies an initial atomic topography which was not derived from atomic mechanics, The laws of physics and chemistry can likewise be applied only to a given set of initial conditions. This is, in fact, true of any general principle that applieri to experience. It must leave indeterminate a range of circumstances in which it can apply, and any particular application of such a principle requires that these circumstances be fixed by some agency not under the control of that principle. This is well known for the laws of physics. The conditions which have to be fixed by some external agency are called here the boundary conditions of the system to which the law of physics is applied, It is on these boundary conditions that the shaping of a piece of metal into a machine takes effect, In other words, machines are systems, in which the boundary conditions left open by physics and chemistry are controlled by certain structural and operational principles. And hence machines cannot be described in terms of physics and chemistry. What is true of machines is, of course, equally true of the machine-like functions of living beings. Such functions are determined by structural and operational principles which control the boundary_conditions left open by physics and chemistry. Living beings operating as machines can, therefore, not be described in terms of physics and chemistry. The material of a machine is thus under the control of two independent principles. The role of the two is very different. If the laws of physics and chemistry were suspended for a moment, all machines would stop working; their operational principles rely for their performance on these laws. This does not hold in reverse. Pulverise a machine and its fragments will continue to obey the laws of physics and chemistry. The wrecking of the operational structure does not affect these laws, for they apply to the material of the machine in itself even when split into isolated bits of matter. A machine or a living being functioning like a machine can be said therefore to comprise two levels. There is an upper compre- hensive level, controlled by certain structural and operational principles. The lower level is formed as it were by the unorganised mass, the higher level by the principle that controls its organisation In other words, we have a lower level of isolated parts and a higher level of the functional whole formed by the parts. This higher level represents then the joint functions of the parts. We see here the beginnings of a hierarchy in which the distinction between things essentially higher and essentially lower 1 will be restored. 1 The argument of this section was first developed in this form in &quot;Tacit Knowing: Its Bearing on Some Problems of Philosophy, 11 Reviews of Modern Physics (Vol. 34, 1962, pp. 601-615), We can find reproduced the two-leveled structure of machines - and of living beings working like machines - in the playing of a game of chess. The conduct of such a game is an entity controlled by a stratagem and the stratagem relies on the observance of the rules of chess. This relation does not hold in reverse, for the rules of chess leave open an infinite range of stratagems. Moves of chess are therefore meaningless by_themselves and their meaning lies in serving jointly the performance of a stratagem. An intellectual skill can comprise a number of levels in the form of a hierarchy. The production of a literary composition, for example of a speech, includes five levels. The first level, lowest of all, is the production of a voice; the second, the utterance of words; the third, the joining of words to make sentences the f~urth, the working of sentences into a style; the fifth, and highest, the composition of the text, The principles of each level operate under the control of the next higher level. The voice you produce is shaped into words by a vocabulary; a given vocabulary is shaped into sentences in accordance with a grammar; and the sentences are fitted into a style, which in its turn is made to convey the ideas of the composition, Thus each level is subject to dual control; first, by the laws that apply to its elements in themselves, and second, by the laws that control the comprehensive entity formed by them. Such multiple control is made possible here once more by the fact that the principles governing the isolated particulars of a lower level leave indeterminate their boundary conditions, to be controlled by a higher principle. Voj ce prod11ct,.on leaves J.arg.ely ope; the combination of sounds into words, which is controlled by a vocabulary, Next, a vocabulary leaves largely open the combination of words to form sentences, which is controlled by grammar; and so the sequence goes on, Consequently, the operations of a higher level cannot be accounted for by the laws governing its particulars forming the next lower level. You cannot derive a vocabulary from phonetics; you cannot derive grammar from a vocabulary; a correct use of grammar does not account for good style; and a good style does not supply the content of a piece of prose. This brings us to the most important application of this principle, which is the life of plants, animals and men, But I shall only give here a rough outline of the hierarchy which constitutes a human being. The lowest level is controlled by the laws of inani- mate nature and the higher levels control throughout the boundary condi tion~ __ left open by the laws of the inanimate, The lowest func- tions of life are those called vegetative; these vegetative functions sustaining life at its lowest level, leave open - both in plants and animals - the higher functions of growth and leave open in animals also the operations of muscular action; next in turn, the principles governing muscular action in animals leave open the integration of such action to innate or predisposed systems of behaviour; and again such primitive behaviour is open in its turn to be shaped by intelli- gence; while the working of intelligence itself can be made to serve in man the still higher principles of responsible choice. * Let me now approach the structure of consecutive levels from a different view to which my last three lectures have prepared us, I shall show that the strat.i:t&#x27;1cat1on of&#x27; Peality by successive stages</p>\n<p>- $ - of boundary control can be known by tacit integration and I shall show also that the tacit knowing of a stratified system reproduces the fact that the operations of a higher level cannot be accounted for by the laws governing the particulars of the next lower system. The higher level vanishes the moment our attention is directed to the lower one. I shall take as my example the two-levelled system of a machine, the characteristic relationships of which I have listed on the blackboard. To have something concrete in mind, think of things like a bicycle, a can opener, a watch, a yale lock or an aeroplane. We can know a machine at a variety of stages. We can invent it; or if it is already invented, we can use it. We may come across objects known to be parts of a machine, and guess how they are to be combined to function together; or else we may find an object presumed to be some kind of machine and guess what it is for. And finally, as a student of engineering, we may be shown a machine functioning smoothly and have to find out how it works. All these occasions of arriving at the knowledge of a machine, are guided by the imagination thrusting forward to the aim which the imagination is to perform. We invent a machine by focussing our imagination on a novel achievement surmised to bh feasible, for this evokes the idea of suitable parts controlled by an apposite operational principle. We use a machine by relying on its parts for achieving their joint purpose and it is on this purpose that we focus our action. Our imagination must roam over all possible uses to which a heap of apparently related pieces can be put, if we are to guess how they function together. Only by exploring in our imagination the possib]e uses of a strange ob,jec:t presumed to be a machine, can we discover what it is for. And finally, the student of engineering can arrive at an understanding of a machine only by testing its parts with a view to their possible contribution to the performance of the machine; he too must have the machine as a whole at the focus of his attention. Remember then the way the thrust of the imagination is related to that which implements its purpose, It is the relation of the focal to the subsidiaries. We know a machine by focussing on its performance while relying on our awareness of the physical processes which serve to implement it. Switch now your attention to these physical laws. Explore the physical chemical topography of a machine however meticulously. It will leave you totally ignorant of its operational principle and will fail to reveal the very fact of its existence. Any study of the lower principles controlling the subsidiaries of a comprehensive entity, is meaningless unless it is conducted with a bearing on the way the lower principles serve the higher principles; only when something goes wrong, a boiler bursts or a train derails, is this event to be accounted for by the workings of physics or chemistry which have escaped the restrictions that the higher principles of the machine should impose on its lower principles. But I am afraid you may feel that I have rushed you into this conclusion without having properly linked it to its antecedents. In my second lecture I spoke of two levels of awareness, the subsidiar, and the focal, the subsidiary bearing on the focal, by an act of tacit integration. This framework applied to a finger pointing at an object or a name designating a person, or at a probe exploring a cavity; we saw clues to perception and clues to discovery, features forming a physiognomy and motions combined to a skilled action; we had also the case of two stereo-pictures fused to a spacial vision, This has established the structure of tacit knowledge, and we nailed this result firmly down by the experimental evidence of subception. But the vectorial character of tacit knowing was most - fully confirmed by observing that when we turn our attention on the subsidiaries their function and meaning disappears and the appearance which expressed this meaning is lost. I called this the logical disintegration of tacit knowledge. And now, quite independently, we have hit upon the existence of consecutive levels of reality, which can build up a whole hierarchy of successive, irreducible levels. Looking then at one such pair of levels, we have realised that we know a lower level subsidiarily with a bearing on the upper level, Or more precisely, we know a dually controlled system by focussing our attention on the upper principle as it relies on the workings of the lower principle of which we are subsidiarily aware, Switch our focal attention on these lower workings, and their integrated function is lost from sight and the dual system disappears. We can pick up then also the thread left loose at the end of my second lecture when I identified subsidiary awareness with the type of consciousness we have of our own body and spoke in this sense of tacit awareness as a manner of indwelling. All tacit knowledge can be regarded as an indwelling, but only the tacit knowledge of a system that firmly hangs together can be readily experienced as an indwelling. Some cases that I had listed before, like the exercise of a skill or the features forming a physiognomy, can be obviously</p>\n<p>/ I experienced as such. But the major examples, that I only briefly mentioned, are the comprehensive entities studied by morphology, physiology and psychology. These are the living entities that I have described today as a hierarchy of irreducible levels. And we can add now that we dwell in this hierarchy of levels in a sequence of subsidiary awarenesses, each of which bears on a next higher level of awareness, closer to the focus of our attention that is addressed to the entity as a whole. * Polemical Section But I must turn aside now to face the array of defenses which guard today the view that all things whatsoever are intelligibl&amp; ultimately in terms of the laws ruling the ultimate particles of matter. I propose to show you that the defense of this view consists predominantly in ignoring the objections against it, however obvious they may be. I have said that a Laplacean topography cannot tell us the temperature of any place in the world. Let me explain this. , , It is obvious that a well shuffled pack of cards ceases to random if you manage to peep at their faces and memorise their sequence. It is equally obvious therefore that a random collocation of atoms looses its randomness,,, if you follow Laplace and establish the atomic topo- graphy of the system. The probability of the system&#x27;s configuration is then equal to~\u2022 its entropy is zero and the fundamental laws of thermodynamics, comprising all physical chemistry, are absent. I have published this fact, duly expressed in mathematical terms uearly eight years ago in Personal Kflowledge on pag(;\\ 391, ( I got, ~he deduction from Wigrn,r, who himself could not rem.,mber where Im got it from, so it appears that I shall have to figure for posterity as its author). Since then I have repeatedly referred to the fact that the Laplacean image fails to account for the basic laws of physics, but nobody has yet commented on this. We must ask why this obvious fact has never been told by somebody else in public before. Why is it not a commonplace? Why no one responds to my statement of it? the reason is perhaps that the fact is thought to be inexplicable and hence unprofitable. I myself cannot either give an explanation for this fact, but it does show to me the absurdity of the Laplaceian Universal Knowledge, and it also presents in my view the first in a sequence of other gaps in the Laplaceian universe: gaps which comprise almost everything that is of interest to us in this world. Let me next pass on then to this sequence of missing principles and observe the strange fact that for centuries on end it was the representation of living beings as machines, that has been regarded as equivalent to the denial of any such higher prin- ciples. Machinelike explanations of life were advanced as demonstratir, the fact that life is controlled by the inanimate laws of nature and were rejected by those who upheld the presence of higher principles in living beings. Since the sevent_eenth century some opponents of the Galilean world view have contested the possibility of representing living beings as machines. In his book on Science and Religion (1951) Charles E. Raven tells us how in the 1690 1s writers like the Neo- Platonist Cudworth and the great naturalist John Ray, attacked mechanism as a doctrine explaining life in terms of mere inanimate matter in motion. And look at the other end of the story, three hundred years later, About the turn of the last century an important minority of biologists has arisen, who deny the possibility of representing all living functions by mechanisms of the kind known to engineering and technology. The non-machine-like processes of life which they postu- late, have since been called organismic. Such organismic processes are found at work in regeneration, and are most strikingly demonstra- ted by the embryonic regeneration of the sea urchin discovered by Hans Driesch. Driesch found that throughout the gastrula stage any cell or combination of cells detached from the embryo regenerates the whole embryo. He called this a &#x27;harmonious equipotential&#x27; system, Throughout the subsequent controversy between the scientistE who supported the organismic view and the predominant school who defended a mechanistic explanation of life, it was taken for granted that the issue between the two camps was whether living beings could be represented or not by the laws of inanimate nature - whereas in my opinion both sides equally excluded the representation of life in terms of these laws, whether the process was mechanical or organismic. It is uncomfortable to oppose a fundamental conception that has been current for centuries and still continues to be accepted among philosophers and scientists everywhere today. Professor Nagel extensively discussed in his book The Structure of Science (1961), whether living beings can be explained without referring to the purpo&amp; of their organs and of the functions of these organs. He rightly thinks that if living beings would have to be necessarily described in teleological terms, this would show that they cannot be explained exclusively in physicho-chemical terms. But he does not raise ex- plicitly the question, whether machines themselves can in general be so explained; he takes it implicitly for granted, that they can * be so explained, It is difficult to argue with a tacit assumption, but Nagel does offer a general proposition to which I can address myself, His critique of biological systems is directed to proving that the functions of living things can be defined as mere events taking place without teleological significance; for it is the presence of purpo- sive action that he rightly recognises as the sign of a nonphysi&lt;,al factor in a living mechanism, Let me point out therefore that the achievement of a purpose is an indispensable aspect of a machinery, I have defined a watch earlier on by the fact that it tells the time, while being kept going by the mainspring uncoiling under the control of the hair spring and balance wheel. Since I first wrote down this definition of a watch which I retained in this talk, I first ceme across watches in which the mainspring was replaced by a tiny electri battery; then I met another watch in which there was neither hair spring nor balance wheel, both being replaced by a piezo-electric crystal, that keeps time far more accurately; but I have not come across a watch that does not tell the time, nor do I ever expect to find one, for this purpose is the defining characteristic of a watch. There are still inhabitants deep in the forests of Brazil, who have never seen a watch, Equip them with a complete physical chemical topography of a watch; but not until they discover for themselves that it tells the time, will they know that it is a watch * Commenting on self regulating phisical systems, Nagel writes (p, 4ll that the &quot;fact [or their existency offers strong support for the pre-, sumption that the teleologically organized activities of living orga- nisms and of their parts can be analyzed without requiring the postu- lation of purposes or goals as dynamic agents. 11 He takes it for gran! here that self regulating physical systems can be analyzed in non- teleological terms, and this he regards throughout not without reason, as the token for the possibility of interpreting the system wholly in physical chemical terms. will they understand what a watch is. Some months ago I brought home from America to Oxford a gadget which I had picked up without knowing what it was for. All the analytical laboratories of England could not tell my wife and me that it was an instrument for making simul- taneously two holes in a can of beer; this was its purpose and this its meaning. A textbook of engineering which would teach the struc- ture and operations of technical equipments without revealing their purpose, would be teaching the structure of meaningless objects that are producing meaningless results. Let me say this again. The purpose of a machine is the focus of tacit integration at which its inventor aimed, and aiming at which, he evoked subsidiarily the elements which eventually placed the machine in the service of its purpose. And as he invented it so must it be understood; the learner&#x27;s attention, focussed on its purpose must reveal subsidiarily the appropriate elements and opera- tions which serve this purpose. And I will add a new points to this. Both the invention of a machine and the understanding of it is expressed in a general prin- ciple that must be stated in terms of engineering, that is in referrinf to functional parts like wheel, screws, pistons, levers, etc. and of technical performances, like cutting, grinding, digging, signaling or any kind of manufacturing. If you want the protection of a patent you must limit yourself in your description of your invention to the bare minimum of physical chemical detail. Nothing must be said about the material of the machine, of its size or shape that is not strictl&quot;.,&#x27; required for embodying the principle of your invention. Thus only will you cover the entire class of machines repres&lt;&gt;nted by your ideas and acquire complete protection f&#x27;or the whole class. Far from being defined in terms oi\u00b7 physics and chemistry, the invention will be defined primarily in terms of engineering and refer only secondarily to few,often trivial, physical or chemical facts as necessary require- ments of its performance. The vast majority of physical chemical particulars will be left open over an indefinite range of immense variety. They will all function as subsidiaries to the boundary controlling principle which they may possibly embody. The same can be shown to hold for the organs and functions of an organism, in opposition to Professor Nagel. His main line of thought is to show that we can denote a set of elements and events at a certain time in an organism and then denote likewise a certain set of events caused by these antecedents. He says that we can define in these terms what is usually described as a living function, without saying that it proceeds with the purpose of serving the organism. Nagel does not contest that the process in question may benefit the organism and fully agrees that we should say this to happen, but insists that we can affirm this without saying that it happens for the benefit of the organism. And he claims that once we have thus translated a teleological explanation into a non-teleo- logical one, the living organism can be explained in exclusively physico-chemical terms. My answer to this is in the first place that Nagel talks in physiological terms, namely organs and functions, not asking on what grounds and by what operation these entities have_b~~n integrated /from data of physics and chemistry. Breathing, feeding, drinking, digesting, defecation, urination, copulating, child bearing, sleeping and waking, and even the circulation of the blood were observed with- out any but trivial references to physics and chemistry. Aristotle explored large areas of biology without physics and chemistry. And above all, life itself has been known, as distinct from death and from stones and stars, as one comprehensive entity, from immemorial times, all the way back even by our animal ancestors. We have here a series of comprehensive entities, established by tacit integration. Their particulars are largely unspecifiable, but we recognise their joi~t meaning. The organism itself, comprisin[ all other organs which function in it, has the appearance of being alive and its organs appear to function in serving its life. Only by focussing our attention on the living organism can we recognise the in it/ functions of its organs and this is how we understand them. Since the time that physics and chemistry was developed, biology has made great progress in observing in what way the functions of living beings rely on the laws of physics and chemistry. But the physical chemical study of living organisms remains of no interest to biology unless it bears on the physiological functions which sustain life. I shall look now once more at the argument of Professor Nagel, expressing it in my own way, It amounts to this. Instead of observing that shortage of oxygen will cause us to expand our chest in order to draw lJreath needed for life, we can say that when shortag:c of oxygen causes us to expand our chest, air flows into our lungs and sustains life. In this way we can transform the teleological formulation of organic functions into descriptive statements and biology can then be explained exclusively in physico chemical terms. But the change from a teleological to a descriptive account has taken place within the physiological framework and no evidence ha, been produced that this framework can be replaced by statements made in terms of physics and chemistry. It must be held therefore to be as impossible as before, By denoting for example a state of oxygen shortage by a set of state variables and describing the consequent drawing in of breath, by an algebraic symbol, Professor Nagel has merely paraphrased physiology in terms somewhat resembling the laws of physics and chemistry. What his symbols stand for is still physiology. * Such seeming transposition of higher principles into the laws of inanimate nature is widespread; it has indeed analogies throughout our culture. But at this point I shall remain with the scientific study of life. The most massive proof of the fact that life transcends inanimate nature consists in the consciousness of man and this fact has been therefore an embarrassment to modern psychologJ Consciousness, we are taught, is not a tangible fact and we must hesitate therefore to attribute consciousness to any living being, animal or man. It would seem impossible that neuro-physiologists, let alone psychologists, should deny the existence of consciousness which is a major part of their subject matter. Can one study per- ception without referring to what people see? Or the localisation of emotional centres in the brain, without referring to what the subject feels? Yet a distinguished neuro-physiologist like O. Hebb has urged scientists to assume that consciousness does not exist, even though such a hypothesis might eventually prove false, Nor is this an isolated instance. The psychiatrist, L. S. Kubie, speaking * on the same scientific occasion, declared that a &quot;working concept&quot; of consciousness was indispensable to psychology, and went on to say: sometimes we are explicit and frank about this. Sometimes we fool ourselves about it. Many workers have attempted to avoid using the word because of its traditional connotations, which have had a some- what mystical, imponderable, non-scientific, philosophic and/or theological flavour ..\u2022. Kubie 1 s words show what is happening here. Scientists who urge us to assume that consciousness does not exist do not believe this them- selves. It would be absurd to suppose that Hebb wants neuro-physio- logists to assume that all their subjects are unconscious. He merely wants them to describe their findings as if consciousness did not exist. This is the programme of behaviourism. It sets out, for example, to eliminate all references to the human mind, by substi- tuting for the mind the sound of human speech when telling about a state of mind. Such an enquiry refuses to observe that a man is in pain and it can acknowledge only that he complains of pain. The fact that this view wipes out the purpose of medicine - as the alleviator of human suffering - is disregarded. Behaviourism could describe medicine only as a process for eliminating complaints of pain, even though complaints can be more effectively silenced without medicine. The very conception of compassion is denied and torture is theoretically given free rein. * I am referring here to the contributions made by 0. Hebb and L. S. Kubie to the Symposium on Brain Mechanism and Consciousness held in Quebec in August 1 1953; see report ed. J, F. Delafrayne (Oxford: Blackwells, 19541\u2022 None of this is intended, or even remotely approved,by behaviourists, who call in question the existence of consciousness. It is clear, therefore, that they do not mean what they say when urging us to doubt or disregard or at least avoid mentioning the existence of consciousness. This is what Kubie calls fooling our- selves. It would seem that after three centuries of triumphs achieved in the belief that all manner of things are determined by the laws of inanimate matter, scientists would prefer to engage: in any kind of ambiguity rather than admit that there are other prin- ciples at work in nature, apart from the laws of inanimate nature.</p>",
    "content_text": ") \nLecture 5 \nLevels of Realitv \nby Michael Polan1ri \n(Delivered at Wesleyan University, November 11, 1965) \nI have told you how Copernicus ousted man from his \ncentral position in the universe and destroyed the theological \ncosmos. \nThe heavenly sphere of divine perfection towards which, \nfrom his fallen sublunar existence, man was bound to strive, was \ndissolved in a space without limits, without shape or centre. \nAnd \nmonotony in space was extended into monotony in depth, by the atomic \ntheory of matter. Galileo's mechanics, amplified by Newton, gave \nnew lffe to the theory that all things are ultimately composed of \nmasses in motion. \nAtomic particles alone were real and all phenomena \nwere merely appearances of this ultimate reality. \nMan himself was \nbut a chance collocation of atoms, without purpose or meaning. \nI shall speak in my last lecture in February of the great \nhistorical benefits of this scientific world view. \nBattling for \nfreedom of thought against established authority, it cleared the way \nfor political freedom and humanitarian reforms. Scientific rationa-\nlism brought social and moral progress that has improved almost every \nhuman relationship in western civilization. It has been up to our \nown days, the chief guide towards intellectual, moral and social \nadvances. \nBut troubles developed and became serious in our own \ncentury. \nThe demand that all things must be explained by the laws \nof physics and chemistry became more insistent and more destructive. \nIts inflexible pursuit has deprived our genuine convictions from all \ntheoretical foundations. \nOur whole culture is harassed by self-\ndoubt. \nI shall propose here a principle which would restore our \nacceptance of higher forms of being and show how we can know and do \nknow these less tangible levels of existence. It will be left for \nmy later lectures to outline the way such a change in our conception \nof reality might benefit us culturally and perhaps in public affairs. \n* \nThe mechanical philosophy of Galileo was more fully stated \nby Laplace when defining a Universal Knowledge of the World. \nHe \npointed out that from to-day's topography of the ultimate particles \nof the world (which would include their velocities and the forces \nacting between them) we could calculate any future topography of the \nsame particles, and he claimed that this would give us a knowledge \nof all things to come, to the very end of time. It has been objected \nthat such predictions contradict the exercise of free will, but this \nhad only the effect of calling in question our possession of free wilJ. \nIndeed, to bring up this particular difficulty of free will is to \noverlook the more massive fact, that a Laplacean atomic topography \nwould tell us virtually nothing that is of interest to us. It would \ngive us the total energy of any particular region in the universe, \nbut we could not even make out -as we shall see - whether things \nin that region had any definite temperature, and if so what that \ntemperature was. \nTo fathom the depth of such ignorance parading as Universal \nKnowledge, imagine yourself deprived of all your previous experience \nand presented in its place with a Laplacean topography of the univers6 \nThough you were endowed with an unlimited ability for mechanical \ncomputations, you would search in vain to calculate something worth \nknowing. \nFor what you would want to know are things seen and felt, \nthings heard and smelt, and the laws of mechanics cannot derive such \nknowledge from a topography of atomic particles, \nAlone the action \nof our sentient self, responding to the atoms impinging upon our \nsenses, can supply such information. \nBut even granting, for the sake of argument, our powers \nof sentience and forgetting also that an atomic topography cannot \ndefine temperature, we could still get no further than to derive the \nlaws of physics and chemistry, and this would not enable us to re-\ncognise living and sentient beings. \nIn saying this, I contradict \nthe claims of biologists who affirm that they are explaining life in \nterms of physics and chemistry. \nBut the fact is that they do nothing \nof the kind. \nThe purpose which biology actually pursues, and by \nwhich it achieves its triumphs, consists predominantly in explaining \nthe functions of living beings in terms of a mechanism founded on the \nlaws of physics and chemistry, yet not.explicable by these laws, \nWe can make this clear by showing that no mechanism, not \neven the simplest machine, can be explained in terms of physics and \nchemistry. \nLet me choose as an example of a machine the watch I \nwear on my wrist. \nMy watch tells the time. It is kept going by the \nmain-spring, incoiling under the control of the hair spring and \nbalance wheel, and thus it turns the hands which tell the time, \nSuch \nare the operational principles of a watch, the principles which define \nits construction and working. \nIt is these principles that cannot be \ndefined by the laws of inanimate nature. \nFor no part of a watch is \nformed by the natural equilibration of matter. \nEach is artificially \nshaped and connected to perform its function, \nPhysics and chemistry \ncannot reveal the practical principles embodied in a machine, any \nmore than the physical chemical testing of a printed page can tell \nthe content of its text. \nBut how can we embody any structural or operational prin-\nciple in a piece of inanimate matter, without interfering with the \nlaws of inanimate matter? To answer this question, we must realise \nthat no inanimate object is ever fully determined by the laws of \nphysics and chemistry, \nLaplace himself had to assume for his specu-\nlations on future atomic topographies an initial atomic topography \nwhich was not derived from atomic mechanics, \nThe laws of physics \nand chemistry can likewise be applied only to a given set of initial \nconditions. \nThis is, in fact, true of any general principle that applieri \nto experience. It must leave indeterminate a range of circumstances \nin which it can apply, and any particular application of such a \nprinciple requires that these circumstances be fixed by some agency \nnot under the control of that principle. \nThis is well known for the \nlaws of physics. \nThe conditions which have to be fixed by some \nexternal agency are called here the boundary conditions of the system \nto which the law of physics is applied, It is on these boundary \nconditions that the shaping of a piece of metal into a machine takes \neffect, \nIn other words, machines are systems, in which the boundary \nconditions left open by physics and chemistry are controlled by \ncertain structural and operational principles. \nAnd hence machines \ncannot be described in terms of physics and chemistry. \nWhat is true of machines is, of course, equally true of \nthe machine-like functions of living beings. \nSuch functions are \ndetermined by structural and operational principles which control the \nboundary_conditions left open by physics and chemistry. \nLiving \nbeings operating as machines can, therefore, not be described in \nterms of physics and chemistry. \nThe material of a machine is thus under the control of \ntwo independent principles. \nThe role of the two is very different. \nIf the laws of physics and chemistry were suspended for a moment, \nall machines would stop working; \ntheir operational principles rely \nfor their performance on these laws. \nThis does not hold in reverse. \nPulverise a machine and its fragments will continue to obey the laws \nof physics and chemistry. \nThe wrecking of the operational structure \ndoes not affect these laws, for they apply to the material of the \nmachine in itself even when split into isolated bits of matter. \nA machine or a living being functioning like a machine can \nbe said therefore to comprise two levels. \nThere is an upper compre-\nhensive level, controlled by certain structural and operational \nprinciples. The lower level is formed as it were by the unorganised \nmass, the higher level by the principle that controls its organisation \nIn other words, we have a lower level of isolated parts and a higher \nlevel of the functional whole formed by the parts. \nThis higher level \nrepresents then the joint functions of the parts. \nWe see here the beginnings of a hierarchy in which the \ndistinction between things essentially higher and essentially lower \n1 \nwill be restored. \n1 The argument of this section was first developed in this form in \n\"Tacit Knowing: \nIts Bearing on Some Problems of Philosophy, 11 Reviews \nof Modern Physics (Vol. 34, 1962, pp. 601-615), \nWe can find reproduced the two-leveled structure of \nmachines - and of living beings working like machines - in the \nplaying of a game of chess. \nThe conduct of such a game is an entity \ncontrolled by a stratagem and the stratagem relies on the observance \nof the rules of chess. \nThis relation does not hold in reverse, for \nthe rules of chess leave open an infinite range of stratagems. \nMoves \nof chess are therefore meaningless by_themselves and their meaning \nlies in serving jointly the performance of a stratagem. \nAn intellectual skill can comprise a number of levels in \nthe form of a hierarchy. \nThe production of a literary composition, \nfor example of a speech, includes five levels. \nThe first level, \nlowest of all, is the production of a voice; \nthe second, the \nutterance of words; \nthe third, the joining of words to make sentences \nthe f~urth, the working of sentences into a style; the fifth, and \nhighest, the composition of the text, \nThe principles of each level operate under the control of \nthe next higher level. \nThe voice you produce is shaped into words \nby a vocabulary; \na given vocabulary is shaped into sentences in \naccordance with a grammar; \nand the sentences are fitted into a style, \nwhich in its turn is made to convey the ideas of the composition, \nThus each level is subject to dual control; first, by the laws that \napply to its elements in themselves, and second, by the laws that \ncontrol the comprehensive entity formed by them. \nSuch multiple control is made possible here once more by \nthe fact that the principles governing the isolated particulars of a \nlower level leave indeterminate their boundary conditions, to be \ncontrolled by a higher principle. \nVoj ce prod11ct,.on leaves J.arg.ely ope; \nthe combination of sounds into words, which is controlled by a \nvocabulary, \nNext, a vocabulary leaves largely open the combination \nof words to form sentences, which is controlled by grammar; \nand so \nthe sequence goes on, \nConsequently, the operations of a higher level \ncannot be accounted for by the laws governing its particulars forming \nthe next lower level. \nYou cannot derive a vocabulary from phonetics; \nyou cannot derive grammar from a vocabulary; \na correct use of grammar \ndoes not account for good style; \nand a good style does not supply the \ncontent of a piece of prose. \nThis brings us to the most important application of this \nprinciple, which is the life of plants, animals and men, \nBut I shall \nonly give here a rough outline of the hierarchy which constitutes \na human being. \nThe lowest level is controlled by the laws of inani-\nmate nature and the higher levels control throughout the boundary \ncondi tion~ __ left open by the laws of the inanimate, \nThe lowest func-\ntions of life are those called vegetative; \nthese vegetative functions \nsustaining life at its lowest level, leave open - both in plants and \nanimals - the higher functions of growth and leave open in animals \nalso the operations of muscular action; \nnext in turn, the principles \ngoverning muscular action in animals leave open the integration of \nsuch action to innate or predisposed systems of behaviour; and again \nsuch primitive behaviour is open in its turn to be shaped by intelli-\ngence; \nwhile the working of intelligence itself can be made to serve \nin man the still higher principles of responsible choice. \n* \nLet me now approach the structure of consecutive levels from \na different view to which my last three lectures have prepared us, \nI \nshall show that the strat.i:t'1cat1on of' Peality by successive stages \n\n-\n$ -\nof boundary control can be known by tacit integration and I shall \nshow also that the tacit knowing of a stratified system reproduces \nthe fact that the operations of a higher level cannot be accounted for \nby the laws governing the particulars of the next lower system. \nThe \nhigher level vanishes the moment our attention is directed to the lower \none. \nI shall take as my example the two-levelled system of a \nmachine, the characteristic relationships of which I have listed on \nthe blackboard. \nTo have something concrete in mind, think of things \nlike a bicycle, a can opener, a watch, a yale lock or an aeroplane. \nWe can know a machine at a variety of stages. \nWe can invent it; \nor \nif it is already invented, we can use it. \nWe may come across objects \nknown to be parts of a machine, and guess how they are to be combined \nto function together; \nor else we may find an object presumed to be \nsome kind of machine and guess what it is for. \nAnd finally, as a \nstudent of engineering, we may be shown a machine functioning smoothly \nand have to find out how it works. \nAll these occasions of arriving \nat the knowledge of a machine, are guided by the imagination thrusting \nforward to the aim which the imagination is to perform. \nWe invent a \nmachine by focussing our imagination on a novel achievement surmised \nto bh feasible, for this evokes the idea of suitable parts controlled \nby an apposite operational principle. \nWe use a machine by relying \non its parts for achieving their joint purpose and it is on this \npurpose that we focus our action. \nOur imagination must roam over all \npossible uses to which a heap of apparently related pieces can be put, \nif we are to guess how they function together. \nOnly by exploring in \nour imagination the possib]e uses of a strange ob,jec:t presumed to be a \nmachine, can we discover what it is for. \nAnd finally, the student \nof engineering can arrive at an understanding of a machine only by \ntesting its parts with a view to their possible contribution to the \nperformance of the machine; \nhe too must have the machine as a whole \nat the focus of his attention. \nRemember then the way the thrust of the imagination is \nrelated to that which implements its purpose, It is the relation \nof the focal to the subsidiaries. \nWe know a machine by focussing \non its performance while relying on our awareness of the physical \nprocesses which serve to implement it. \nSwitch now your attention to these physical laws. \nExplore \nthe physical chemical topography of a machine however meticulously. \nIt will leave you totally ignorant of its operational principle and \nwill fail to reveal the very fact of its existence. \nAny study of \nthe lower principles controlling the subsidiaries of a comprehensive \nentity, is meaningless unless it is conducted with a bearing on the \nway the lower principles serve the higher principles; \nonly when \nsomething goes wrong, a boiler bursts or a train derails, is this \nevent to be accounted for by the workings of physics or chemistry \nwhich have escaped the restrictions that the higher principles of the \nmachine should impose on its lower principles. \nBut I am afraid you may feel that I have rushed you into \nthis conclusion without having properly linked it to its antecedents. \nIn my second lecture I spoke of two levels of awareness, the subsidiar, \nand the focal, the subsidiary bearing on the focal, by an act of tacit \nintegration. \nThis framework applied to a finger pointing at an object \nor a name designating a person, or at a probe exploring a cavity; \nwe \nsaw clues to perception and clues to discovery, features forming a \nphysiognomy and motions combined to a skilled action; \nwe had also \nthe case of two stereo-pictures fused to a spacial vision, \nThis has established the structure of tacit knowledge, and \nwe nailed this result firmly down by the experimental evidence of \nsubception. \nBut the vectorial character of tacit knowing was most \n-\nfully confirmed by observing that when we turn our attention on the \nsubsidiaries their function and meaning disappears and the appearance \nwhich expressed this meaning is lost. \nI called this the logical \ndisintegration of tacit knowledge. \nAnd now, quite independently, we have hit upon the existence \nof consecutive levels of reality, which can build up a whole hierarchy \nof successive, irreducible levels. \nLooking then at one such pair of \nlevels, we have realised that we know a lower level subsidiarily with \na bearing on the upper level, \nOr more precisely, we know a dually \ncontrolled system by focussing our attention on the upper principle \nas it relies on the workings of the lower principle of which we are \nsubsidiarily aware, \nSwitch our focal attention on these lower \nworkings, and their integrated function is lost from sight and the \ndual system disappears. \nWe can pick up then also the thread left loose at the end \nof my second lecture when I identified subsidiary awareness with the \ntype of consciousness we have of our own body and spoke in this sense \nof tacit awareness as a manner of indwelling. \nAll tacit knowledge \ncan be regarded as an indwelling, but only the tacit knowledge of a \nsystem that firmly hangs together can be readily experienced as an \nindwelling. \nSome cases that I had listed before, like the exercise of \na skill or the features forming a physiognomy, can be obviously \n\n/ \nI \nexperienced as such. \nBut the major examples, that I only briefly \nmentioned, are the comprehensive entities studied by morphology, \nphysiology and psychology. \nThese are the living entities that I \nhave described today as a hierarchy of irreducible levels. \nAnd we \ncan add now that we dwell in this hierarchy of levels in a sequence \nof subsidiary awarenesses, each of which bears on a next higher \nlevel of awareness, closer to the focus of our attention that is \naddressed to the entity as a whole. \n* \nPolemical Section \nBut I must turn aside now to face the array of defenses \nwhich guard today the view that all things whatsoever are intelligibl& \nultimately in terms of the laws ruling the ultimate particles of \nmatter. \nI propose to show you that the defense of this view consists \npredominantly in ignoring the objections against it, however obvious \nthey may be. \nI have said that a Laplacean topography cannot tell us \nthe temperature of any place in the world. \nLet me explain this. \n, , \nIt is obvious that a well shuffled pack of cards ceases to random if \nyou manage to peep at their faces and memorise their sequence. \nIt is \nequally obvious therefore that a random collocation of atoms looses \nits randomness,,, if you follow Laplace and establish the atomic topo-\ngraphy of the system. \nThe probability of the system's configuration \nis then equal to~\u2022 its entropy is zero and the fundamental laws \nof thermodynamics, comprising all physical chemistry, are absent. \nI have published this fact, duly expressed in mathematical terms \nuearly eight years ago in Personal Kflowledge on pag(;\\ 391, ( I got, ~he \ndeduction from Wigrn,r, who himself could not rem.,mber where Im got it \nfrom, so it appears that I shall have to figure for posterity as its \nauthor). \nSince then I have repeatedly referred to the fact that the \nLaplacean image fails to account for the basic laws of physics, but \nnobody has yet commented on this. \nWe must ask why this obvious fact has never been told by \nsomebody else in public before. \nWhy is it not a commonplace? \nWhy \nno one responds to my statement of it? the reason is perhaps that \nthe fact is thought to be inexplicable and hence unprofitable. \nI \nmyself cannot either give an explanation for this fact, but it does \nshow to me the absurdity of the Laplaceian Universal Knowledge, and \nit also presents in my view the first in a sequence of other gaps in \nthe Laplaceian universe: \ngaps which comprise almost everything that \nis of interest to us in this world. \nLet me next pass on then to this sequence of missing \nprinciples and observe the strange fact that for centuries on end \nit was the representation of living beings as machines, that has \nbeen regarded as equivalent to the denial of any such higher prin-\nciples. \nMachinelike explanations of life were advanced as demonstratir, \nthe fact that life is controlled by the inanimate laws of nature and \nwere rejected by those who upheld the presence of higher principles \nin living beings. \nSince the sevent_eenth century some opponents of the \nGalilean world view have contested the possibility of representing \nliving beings as machines. \nIn his book on Science and Religion (1951) \nCharles E. Raven tells us how in the 1690 1s writers like the Neo-\nPlatonist Cudworth and the great naturalist John Ray, attacked \nmechanism as a doctrine explaining life in terms of mere inanimate \nmatter in motion. \nAnd look at the other end of the story, three hundred years \nlater, \nAbout the turn of the last century an important minority of \nbiologists has arisen, who deny the possibility of representing all \nliving functions by mechanisms of the kind known to engineering and \ntechnology. \nThe non-machine-like processes of life which they postu-\nlate, have since been called organismic. \nSuch organismic processes \nare found at work in regeneration, and are most strikingly demonstra-\nted by the embryonic regeneration of the sea urchin discovered by \nHans Driesch. \nDriesch found that throughout the gastrula stage any \ncell or combination of cells detached from the embryo regenerates the \nwhole embryo. \nHe called this a 'harmonious equipotential' system, \nThroughout the subsequent controversy between the scientistE \nwho supported the organismic view and the predominant school who \ndefended a mechanistic explanation of life, it was taken for granted \nthat the issue between the two camps was whether living beings could \nbe represented or not by the laws of inanimate nature - whereas in \nmy opinion both sides equally excluded the representation of life in \nterms of these laws, whether the process was mechanical or organismic. \nIt is uncomfortable to oppose a fundamental conception that \nhas been current for centuries and still continues to be accepted \namong philosophers and scientists everywhere today. \nProfessor Nagel \nextensively discussed in his book The Structure of Science (1961), \nwhether living beings can be explained without referring to the purpo& \nof their organs and of the functions of these organs. \nHe rightly \nthinks that if living beings would have to be necessarily described \nin teleological terms, this would show that they cannot be explained \nexclusively in physicho-chemical terms. \nBut he does not raise ex-\nplicitly the question, whether machines themselves can in general \nbe so explained; \nhe takes it implicitly for granted, that they can \n* \nbe so explained, \nIt is difficult to argue with a tacit assumption, but \nNagel does offer a general proposition to which I can address myself, \nHis critique of biological systems is directed to proving that the \nfunctions of living things can be defined as mere events taking place \nwithout teleological significance; \nfor it is the presence of purpo-\nsive action that he rightly recognises as the sign of a nonphysi<,al \nfactor in a living mechanism, \nLet me point out therefore that the \nachievement of a purpose is an indispensable aspect of a machinery, \nI have defined a watch earlier on by the fact that it tells the time, \nwhile being kept going by the mainspring uncoiling under the control \nof the hair spring and balance wheel. \nSince I first wrote down this \ndefinition of a watch which I retained in this talk, I first ceme \nacross watches in which the mainspring was replaced by a tiny electri \nbattery; \nthen I met another watch in which there was neither hair \nspring nor balance wheel, both being replaced by a piezo-electric \ncrystal, that keeps time far more accurately; \nbut I have not come \nacross a watch that does not tell the time, nor do I ever expect to \nfind one, for this purpose is the defining characteristic of a watch. \nThere are still inhabitants deep in the forests of Brazil, \nwho have never seen a watch, \nEquip them with a complete physical \nchemical topography of a watch; \nbut not until they discover for \nthemselves that it tells the time, will they know that it is a watch \n* Commenting on self regulating phisical systems, Nagel writes (p, 4ll \nthat the \"fact [or their existency offers strong support for the pre-, \nsumption that the teleologically organized activities of living orga-\nnisms and of their parts can be analyzed without requiring the postu-\nlation of purposes or goals as dynamic agents. 11 \nHe takes it for gran! \nhere that self regulating physical systems can be analyzed in non-\nteleological terms, and this he regards throughout not without reason, \nas the token for the possibility of interpreting the system wholly in \nphysical chemical terms. \nwill they understand what a watch is. \nSome months ago I brought home \nfrom America to Oxford a gadget which I had picked up without knowing \nwhat it was for. \nAll the analytical laboratories of England could \nnot tell my wife and me that it was an instrument for making simul-\ntaneously two holes in a can of beer; \nthis was its purpose and this \nits meaning. \nA textbook of engineering which would teach the struc-\nture and operations of technical equipments without revealing their \npurpose, would be teaching the structure of meaningless objects that \nare producing meaningless results. \nLet me say this again. \nThe purpose of a machine is the \nfocus of tacit integration at which its inventor aimed, and aiming \nat which, he evoked subsidiarily the elements which eventually placed \nthe machine in the service of its purpose. \nAnd as he invented it \nso must it be understood; \nthe learner's attention, focussed on its \npurpose must reveal subsidiarily the appropriate elements and opera-\ntions which serve this purpose. \nAnd I will add a new points to this. \nBoth the invention of \na machine and the understanding of it is expressed in a general prin-\nciple that must be stated in terms of engineering, that is in referrinf \nto functional parts like wheel, screws, pistons, levers, etc. and of \ntechnical performances, like cutting, grinding, digging, signaling \nor any kind of manufacturing. \nIf you want the protection of a patent \nyou must limit yourself in your description of your invention to the \nbare minimum of physical chemical detail. \nNothing must be said about \nthe material of the machine, of its size or shape that is not strictl\".,' \nrequired for embodying the principle of your invention. \nThus only \nwill you cover the entire class of machines repres<>nted by your ideas \nand acquire complete protection f'or the whole class. \nFar from being \ndefined in terms oi\u00b7 physics and chemistry, the invention will be \ndefined primarily in terms of engineering and refer only secondarily \nto few,often trivial, physical or chemical facts as necessary require-\nments of its performance. \nThe vast majority of physical chemical \nparticulars will be left open over an indefinite range of immense \nvariety. \nThey will all function as subsidiaries to the boundary \ncontrolling principle which they may possibly embody. \nThe same can be shown to hold for the organs and functions \nof an organism, in opposition to Professor Nagel. \nHis main line of \nthought is to show that we can denote a set of elements and events \nat a certain time in an organism and then denote likewise a certain \nset of events caused by these antecedents. \nHe says that we can \ndefine in these terms what is usually described as a living function, \nwithout saying that it proceeds with the purpose of serving the \norganism. \nNagel does not contest that the process in question may \nbenefit the organism and fully agrees that we should say this to \nhappen, but insists that we can affirm this without saying that it \nhappens for the benefit of the organism. \nAnd he claims that once \nwe have thus translated a teleological explanation into a non-teleo-\nlogical one, the living organism can be explained in exclusively \nphysico-chemical terms. \nMy answer to this is in the first place that Nagel talks \nin physiological terms, namely organs and functions, not asking on \nwhat grounds and by what operation these entities have_b~~n integrated \n/from data of physics and chemistry. \nBreathing, feeding, drinking, \ndigesting, defecation, urination, copulating, child bearing, sleeping \nand waking, and even the circulation of the blood were observed with-\nout any but trivial references to physics and chemistry. \nAristotle \nexplored large areas of biology without physics and chemistry. \nAnd \nabove all, life itself has been known, as distinct from death and \nfrom stones and stars, as one comprehensive entity, from immemorial \ntimes, all the way back even by our animal ancestors. \nWe have here a series of comprehensive entities, established \nby tacit integration. \nTheir particulars are largely unspecifiable, \nbut we recognise their joi~t meaning. \nThe organism itself, comprisin[ \nall other organs which function in it, has the appearance of being \nalive and its organs appear to function in serving its life. Only \nby focussing our attention on the living organism can we recognise \nthe \nin it/ functions of its organs and this is how we understand them. \nSince the time that physics and chemistry was developed, biology \nhas made great progress in observing in what way the functions of \nliving beings rely on the laws of physics and chemistry. \nBut the \nphysical chemical study of living organisms remains of no interest \nto biology unless it bears on the physiological functions which \nsustain life. \nI shall look now once more at the argument of Professor \nNagel, expressing it in my own way, \nIt amounts to this. \nInstead of \nobserving that shortage of oxygen will cause us to expand our chest \nin order to draw lJreath needed for life, we can say that when shortag:c \nof oxygen causes us to expand our chest, air flows into our lungs \nand sustains life. \nIn this way we can transform the teleological \nformulation of organic functions into descriptive statements and \nbiology can then be explained exclusively in physico chemical terms. \nBut the change from a teleological to a descriptive account \nhas taken place within the physiological framework and no evidence ha, \nbeen produced that this framework can be replaced by statements made \nin terms of physics and chemistry. It must be held therefore to be \nas impossible as before, \nBy denoting for example a state of oxygen \nshortage by a set of state variables and describing the consequent \ndrawing in of breath, by an algebraic symbol, Professor Nagel has \nmerely paraphrased physiology in terms somewhat resembling the laws \nof physics and chemistry. \nWhat his symbols stand for is still \nphysiology. \n* \nSuch seeming transposition of higher principles into the \nlaws of inanimate nature is widespread; it has indeed analogies \nthroughout our culture. \nBut at this point I shall remain with the \nscientific study of life. \nThe most massive proof of the fact that \nlife transcends inanimate nature consists in the consciousness of man \nand this fact has been therefore an embarrassment to modern psychologJ \nConsciousness, we are taught, is not a tangible fact and we must \nhesitate therefore to attribute consciousness to any living being, \nanimal or man. \nIt would seem impossible that neuro-physiologists, \nlet alone psychologists, should deny the existence of consciousness \nwhich is a major part of their subject matter. \nCan one study per-\nception without referring to what people see? Or the localisation \nof emotional centres in the brain, without referring to what the \nsubject feels? Yet a distinguished neuro-physiologist like O. Hebb \nhas urged scientists to assume that consciousness does not exist, \neven though such a hypothesis might eventually prove false, \nNor is \nthis an isolated instance. \nThe psychiatrist, L. S. Kubie, speaking \n* \non the same scientific occasion, declared that a \"working concept\" \nof consciousness was indispensable to psychology, and went on to say: \nsometimes we are explicit and frank about this. \nSometimes we fool ourselves about it. Many workers \nhave attempted to avoid using the word because of \nits traditional connotations, which have had a some-\nwhat mystical, imponderable, non-scientific, philosophic \nand/or theological flavour ..\u2022. \nKubie 1 s words show what is happening here. Scientists who urge us \nto assume that consciousness does not exist do not believe this them-\nselves. It would be absurd to suppose that Hebb wants neuro-physio-\nlogists to assume that all their subjects are unconscious. \nHe merely \nwants them to describe their findings as if consciousness did not \nexist. \nThis is the programme of behaviourism. It sets out, for \nexample, to eliminate all references to the human mind, by substi-\ntuting for the mind the sound of human speech when telling about a \nstate of mind. \nSuch an enquiry refuses to observe that a man is in \npain and it can acknowledge only that he complains of pain. \nThe \nfact that this view wipes out the purpose of medicine - as the \nalleviator of human suffering - is disregarded. \nBehaviourism could \ndescribe medicine only as a process for eliminating complaints of \npain, even though complaints can be more effectively silenced without \nmedicine. \nThe very conception of compassion is denied and torture \nis theoretically given free rein. \n* I am referring here to the contributions made by 0. Hebb and L. S. \nKubie to the Symposium on Brain Mechanism and Consciousness held in \nQuebec in August 1 1953; \nsee report ed. J, F. Delafrayne (Oxford: \nBlackwells, 19541\u2022 \nNone of this is intended, or even remotely approved,by \nbehaviourists, who call in question the existence of consciousness. \nIt is clear, therefore, that they do not mean what they say when \nurging us to doubt or disregard or at least avoid mentioning the \nexistence of consciousness. \nThis is what Kubie calls fooling our-\nselves. \nIt would seem that after three centuries of triumphs \nachieved in the belief that all manner of things are determined by \nthe laws of inanimate matter, scientists would prefer to engage: in \nany kind of ambiguity rather than admit that there are other prin-\nciples at work in nature, apart from the laws of inanimate nature.",
